      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“<span class="italic">I</span> cheated?” Marq shouted to Sybyl. The coliseum crowd seethed. “Joan of Arc explaining computational metaphysics? <span class="italic">I</span> cheated?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You started it!” Sybyl said. “You think I don’t know when my office has been rigged? You think you’re dealing with an amateur?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, I—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“—and I don’t know a character-constraint matrix when I find one glued into my Joan sim?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, I—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You think I’m not as bright?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This is scandalous!” said Monsieur Boker. “What did you <span class="italic">do</span>? It’s enough to make me believe in witchcraft!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You mean to say you <span class="italic">don’t</span>?” Marq’s client said, ever the Skeptic. He and Boker began to argue, adding to the indignant shouts of the crowd, now waxing hysterical.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The president of Artifice Associates, rubbing his temples, murmured, “Ruined. We’re ruined. We’ll never be able to explain.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl’s attention was diverted. The mechman she had noticed earlier, holding his honey-haired, human companion’s hand, rushed down the aisle toward the screen. As it passed by, one of its three free hands happened to brush her skirt. “Pardon,” it said, pausing just long enough for Sybyl to read the mechstamp on its chest.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Did that thing dare to touch you?” Monsieur Boker asked. His face swelled with rage.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, no, nothing like that,” Sybyl said. The mechman, pulling his human companion with him, fled toward the screen.</span></p><a id="page178"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Do you know it?” Marq asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“In a way,” Sybyl replied. In the café/sim she had modeled the Garçon 213-ADM interactive character after it. Laziness, perhaps, had led her to simply holo-copy the physical appearance of a standard tiktok-form. Like all artists, sim-programmers borrowed from life; they didn’t create it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She watched as the tiktok—she thought of it as <span class="italic">Garçon,</span> now—elbowed his way down the jammed aisle, past screaming, cheering, jeering people—toward the screen.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Their progress did not go unnoticed. Overcome with disgust—to see a mechman holding hands with an attractive, honey-haired young girl!—Preservers shouted insults and epithets as they rushed by.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Throw it out!” someone howled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl saw the tiktok go rigid, as though bristling at the use of the objective pronoun. Tiktoks had no personal names, but to be referred to as an “it” seemed to affect the thing. Or was she projecting? she wondered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s that doing in here?” a man of ruddy complexion yelled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We’ve got laws against that!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Mechmuck!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Grab it!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Kick it out!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Don’t let it get away!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The girl responded by gripping Garçon’s upper left hand even more tightly and flinging her free arm around his neck.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>When they reached the platform, the tiktok’s undercarriage screeched, laboring at the irregular surfaces. All four of its arms waved off a hail of zot-corn and drugdrink containers, catching them with expert grace, as if it had been engineered for that specific task.</span></p><a id="page179"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>The girl shouted something to the tiktok which Sybyl could not hear. The tiktok prostrated itself at the feet of the towering holograms.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire peered down. “Get up! Except for purposes of lovemaking, I can’t stand to see anyone on his knees.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire then dropped to his own knees at the feet of the towering Maid. Behind Garçon and the woman, the crowd surrendered what was left of its restraint. Bedlam broke out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan gazed down and smiled—a slow, sensuous curve Sybyl had never seen before. She held her breath with excited foreboding.</span></p>
