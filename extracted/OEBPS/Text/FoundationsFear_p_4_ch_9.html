      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>She winked out of the sim-space, away from him, confused.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Somehow she had experienced two conversations at once. Hers and Voltaire’s—the two identities running simultaneously.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>About her, space itself shrank, expanded, warped its contents into bizarre shapes—before lurching at last into concrete objects.</span></p><a id="page333"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>The street corner looked familiar. Still, the white plastiform tables, matching chairs, and tiktok waiters bearing trays to lounging customers—all that had disappeared. The elegant awning still hung over the sidewalk, imprinted with the name the inn’s waiter, Garçon ADM–213, had taught her how to read: <span class="italic">Aux Deux Magots.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire was banging on the door when Joan materialized beside him. “You’re late,” he said. “I have accomplished marvels in the time that it took you to get here.” He interrupted his assault on the inn door to cup her chin and peer into her upturned face. “Are you all right?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I, I think so.” Joan straightened her clanking suit of mail. “You nearly…lost me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My experiment with splitting taught me much.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I…liked it. Like heaven, in a way.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“More like being able to experience each other in a profound manner, I would venture. I discovered that, if we could deliberately seize control of our pleasure systems, we could reproduce the pleasure of success—all without the need for any actual accomplishment.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Heaven, then?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, the opposite. That would be the end of everything.” Voltaire retied the satin ribbon at his throat with sharp, decisive jerks.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Faith would have told you as much.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Alas, true.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You have decided to ‘run background’ for only your mind?” she asked demurely—though proud to have pried an admission for virtue from him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For the moment. I am running both of us with only rudimentary bodies. Yet you shall not notice it, for you shall be quite—” he lifted an eyebrow “—high-minded about matters.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I am relieved. One’s reputation is like one’s<a id="page334"></a> chastity.” Was chaste St. Catherine right? Had Voltaire ruined hers? “Once gone, it cannot be restored.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Thank heaven for that! You have no idea how tedious it is to make love to a virgin.” He added hastily, in response to her reproachful look, “I know of only one exception to that rule,” and gave her a courteous bow.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan said, “The café appears closed.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nonsense. Paris café never close; they are rooms of public rest.” He resumed rapping on the door.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“By public restroom, do you mean an inn?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire stopped knocking and eyed her. “Public restrooms are facilities in which people relieve themselves.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan blushed, envisioning a row of holes dug in the ground. “But why call it a <span class="italic">rest</span>room?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“As long as man is ashamed of his natural functions, he will call it anything but what it is. People fear their hidden selves, afraid that they will burst out.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But I can see all of myself now.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“True. But in real folk, such as we were, subprograms others cannot see run simultaneously beneath the surface thoughts. Like your voices.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan bristled. “My voices are divine! Musics of archangels and saints!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You appear to have occasional access to your subprograms. Many real—that is, embodied—people do not. Especially if the subprograms are unacceptable.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Unacceptable? To whom?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“To us. Or rather, to our dominant program, the one we most identify with and present for show to the world.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah…” Events were moving rather too swiftly for Joan. Did this mean she needed more “time-steps”?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A huge tiktok guard opened the door, grumbling. <span class="italic">“Aux Deux Magots?”</span> he said in response to Voltaire. “Went outta business years ago.”</span></p><a id="page335"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan peered inside the warehouse, hoping to see Garçon.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They’re en route,” Voltaire said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To Joan’s surprise he sneezed. No one caught cold in these abstruse spaces. So he <span class="italic">had</span> kept some fragment of his body. But what an odd piece to retain.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He said lamely, “My editing is imperfect, I gather. I did not omit sniffles, yet I cannot sustain an erection.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire down-stepped them and external time (whatever that meant here) sped by. Without warning, Joan found herself peering at a tiktok. “Garçon ADM–213!” She embraced him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">A votre service,</span> madam. May I recommend the cloud food?” The tiktok kissed his fingertips—all twenty at once.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan looked at Voltaire, too moved to speak. “<span class="italic">Merci,</span>” she managed to stammer at last. “To Voltaire, the Prince of Light, and to the Creator, from Whom all blessings flow.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The credit is entirely mine,” said Voltaire. “I have never shared a byline, even with deities.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She asked nervously, “The…<span class="italic">It</span>…which nearly erased me?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He scowled. “I have felt that apparition—or rather, its lack of appearance, while manifesting a presence. It stalks us still, I fear.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon said, “Could it be the wolf-pack programs who seek criminal users of computational volume?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire raised an eyebrow. “You have become learned, Garçon? I have swept aside these bloodhounds. No, this <span class="italic">It</span> is…other.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We must defeat it!” Joan felt herself a warrior again.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ummm, no doubt. We may need your angels, my sweet. And we must consider where we truly are.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With a wave he blew away the roof, revealing the<a id="page336"></a> bowl of a vast sky. Not the sprinkling of lights she had known—though when she tried, she could in fact recall no specific constellations.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Here the sky blazed with so many stars it hurt her eyes. He said this was because they were near the center of some territory named “Galaxy” and that stars liked to dwell here.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The sight made her suck in her breath. On such a stage, what could they do?</span></p>
