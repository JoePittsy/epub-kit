      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Sybyl waited nervously for her turn on the agenda of the executive meeting of Artifice Associates. She sat opposite Marq, contributing nothing to the discussion, as colleagues and superiors discussed this aspect and that of the company’s operation. Her mind was elsewhere, but not so far gone as to fail to notice the curly hair on the back of Marq’s hands, and a single vein that pulsed—sensuous music—in his neck.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As the president of Artifice Associates dismissed all those not directly involved in the Preserver-Skeptic Project, Sybyl assembled the notes she’d prepared to present her case. Of those present, she knew she could count only on Marq’s support. But she was confident that, with it, the others would go along with her proposal.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The day before, she had told the Special Projects Committee, for the first time, the Maid had broken her reclusive pattern. She initiated contact, instead of waiting to be summoned, trailing her usual air of reluctance. She’d been deeply disturbed to learn from “Monsieur Arouet” that she must defeat him in what she called “the trial,” or else be consigned once again to oblivion.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>When Sybyl had acknowledged that that was probably true, the Maid became convinced that she was going to be cast again into “the fire.” Disoriented and confused, she begged Sybyl to allow her to retire, to consult her “voices.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl had furnished her with restful wallpaper backgrounds: forest, fields, tinkling streams.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She probed for vestigial memories like those Marq<a id="page157"></a> had mentioned, of a debate 8,000 years ago. Joan did carry traces, just bits someone had overlooked in a previous erasing. Joan identified Faith with something called “robots.” Apparently these were mythical figures who would guide humanity; perhaps some deities?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Several hours later, Joan had emerged from her interior landscape. She requested high-level reading skills, so that she might compete with her “inquisitor” on a more equal footing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I explained to her that I couldn’t alter her programming without this committee’s consent.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What about your client?” the president wanted to know.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Monsieur Boker found out—he wouldn’t tell me how; a press leak, I suspect—that Voltaire is to be her rival in the debate. Now <span class="italic">he’s</span> threatening to back out unless I give her additional data and skills.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And…Seldon?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He’s saying nothing. Just wants to be sure he’s not implicated.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Does Boker know we’re handling Voltaire for the Skeptics as well as Joan for him?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl shook her head.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Thank the Cosmic for that,” said the executive of Special Projects.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Marq?” the president asked, eyebrows raised.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Since Marq had once suggested the very course Sybyl now proposed, she assumed his accord. So she was stunned when he said, “I’m against it. Both sides want a verbal duel between intuitive faith and inductive/deductive reason. Update the Maid, and all we will succeed in doing is muddying the issue.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Marq!” Sybyl cried out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Heated discussion followed. Marq fired one objection after another at everyone who favored the idea. Except Sybyl, whose gaze he carefully avoided.<a id="page158"></a> When it became apparent no consensus would be reached, the president made the decision in Sybyl’s favor.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl pressed her advantage. “I’d also like permission to delete from the Maid’s programming her memory of being burned alive at the stake. Her fear that she’ll be sentenced to a similar fate again makes it impossible for her to present the case for Faith as freely as she could if that memory didn’t darken her thoughts.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I object,” Marq said. “Martyrdom is the only way a person can become famous without ability. The Maid who did not suffer martyrdom for her beliefs isn’t the Maid of prehistory at all.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl shot back, “But we don’t <span class="italic">know</span> that history! These sims are from the Dark Ages. Her trauma—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“To delete her memory of that experience would be like—well, think of some of the prehistory legends.” Marq spread his hands. “Even their religions! It would be like re-creating Christ—their ancient deity—without his crucifixion.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl glared at him, but Marq addressed the president, as if she did not exist. “Intact, that’s how our clients want—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m willing to let Voltaire be deleted of all he suffered at the hands of authority, too,” she countered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m not,” said Marq. “Voltaire without defiance of authority would not be Voltaire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl let the other committee members argue the point, nonplused by the incomprehensible change in Marq. It all passed by like a dream. Finally, she accepted her superiors’ final decision—a compromise, because she had no choice. The Maid’s information bank would be updated, but she would not be allowed to forget her fiery death. Nor would Voltaire be allowed to forget the constant fear of reprisals from church and state, in that ancient, murky era.</span></p><a id="page159"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>The president said, “I remind you that we’re skating on thin e-field here. Sims like this are <span class="italic">taboo.</span> Junin Sector elements offered us a big bonus to even attempt this—and we’ve succeeded. But we’re taking risks. Big ones.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As they left the conference room Sybyl whispered to Marq, “You’re up to something.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He looked distracted. “Research. Y’know, that’s when you’re working hard, but you don’t know where you’re going.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He walked on, obliviously, while she stood with her mouth open. How <span class="italic">could</span> she read this man?</span></p>
