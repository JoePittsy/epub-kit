      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Voltaire loomed—brows furrowed, scowling, hands on skinny hips. He rose from the richly embroidered chair in his study at Cirey, the chateau of his long-term mistress, the Marquise du Chatelet.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The place he had called home for fifteen years depressed him, now that she was gone. And now the marquis, without the decency to wait until his wife’s body was cold, had informed him that he must leave.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Get me out of here!” Voltaire demanded of the scientist who finally answered his call. <span class="italic">Scientist</span>—a fresh word, one no doubt derived from the Latin root, <span class="italic">to know.</span> But this fellow looked as though he knew little. “I want to go to the café. I need to see the Maid.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The scientist leaned over the control board<a id="page126"></a> Voltaire was already beginning to resent, and smiled with transparent pleasure at his power. “I didn’t think she was your type. You showed a strong preference all your life—remember, I’ve scanned your memories, you have no secrets—for brainy women. Like your niece and the Madame du Chatelet.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So? Who truly can abide the company of stupid women? The only thing that can be said on their behalf is that they can be trusted, as they’re too stupid to practice deceit.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Unlike Madame du Chatelet?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire drummed his fingers impatiently on the beautifully wrought walnut desk—a gift from Madame du Chatelet, he recalled. How had it gotten to this rude place? Could it indeed have been assembled from his memory alone? “True, she betrayed me. She paid dearly for it, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The scientist arched a brow. “With that young officer, you mean? The one who made her pregnant?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“At forty-three, a married woman with three grown children has no business becoming pregnant!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You hit the roof when she told you—understandable but not very enlightened. Yet you didn’t break off with her. You were with her throughout the birth.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire fumed. Memory dark, memory flowing like black waters in a subterranean river. He’d worried himself sick about the birth, which had proved amazingly easy. Yet nine days later, the most extraordinary woman he had ever known was dead. Of childbed fever. No one—not even his niece and housekeeper and former paramour, Madame Denis, who took care of him thereafter—had ever been able to take her place. He had mourned her until, until—he approached the thought, veered away—<span class="italic">till he died</span>…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He puffed out his cheeks and spat back rapidly, “She persuaded me that it would be unreasonable to<a id="page127"></a> break with a ‘woman of exceptional breeding and talent’ merely for exercising the same rights that I enjoyed. Especially since I hadn’t made love to her for months. The rights of man, she said, belonged to women, too—provided they were of the aristocracy. I allowed her gentle reasonableness to persuade me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah,” the scientist said enigmatically.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire rubbed his forehead, heavy with brooding remembrance. “She was an exception to every rule. She understood Newton and Locke. She understood every word that I wrote. She understood <span class="italic">me.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Why weren’t you making love to her? Too busy going to orgies?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My dear sir, my participation in such festivities has been greatly exaggerated. It’s true, I accepted an invitation to one such celebration of erotic pleasure in my youth. I acquitted myself so well, I was invited to return.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Did you?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Certainly not. Once, a philosopher. Twice, a pervert.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What <span class="italic">I</span> don’t understand is why a man of your worldliness should be so intent on another meeting with the Maid.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Her passion,” Voltaire said, an image of the robust Maid rising clearly in his mind’s eye. “Her courage and devotion to what she believed.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You possessed that trait as well.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire stomped his foot, but the floor made no sound. “Why do you speak of me in the past tense?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sorry. I’ll fill in that audio background, too.” A single hand gesture, and Voltaire heard boards creak as he paced. A carriage team clip-clopped by outside.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I possess temperament. Do not confuse passion with temperament—which is a matter of the nerves. Passion is borne from the heart and soul, no mere mechanism of the bodily humors.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You believe in souls?”</span></p><a id="page128"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“In essences, certainly. The Maid dared cling to her vision with her whole heart, despite bullying by church and state. Her devotion to her vision, unlike mine, bore no taint of perverseness. She was the first true Protestant. I’ve always preferred Protestants to papist absolutists—until I took up residence in Geneva, only to discover their public hatred of pleasure is as great as any pope’s. Only Quakers do not privately engage in what they publicly claim to abjure. Alas, a hundred true believers cannot redeem millions of hypocrites.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The scientist twisted his mouth skeptically. “Joan recanted, knuckled under to their threats.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They took her to a cemetery!” Voltaire bristled with irritation. “Terrorized a credulous girl with threats of death and hell. Bishops, academicians—the most learned men of their time! Donkeys’ asses, the lot! Browbeating the bravest woman in France, a woman whom they destroyed only to revere. Hypocrites! They require martyrs as leeches require blood. They thrive on self-sacrifice—provided that the selves they sacrifice are not their own.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“All we have is your version, and hers. Our history doesn’t go back that far. Still, we know more of people now—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So you imagine.” Voltaire sniffed a jot of snuff to calm himself. “Villains are undone by what is worst in them, heroes by what is best. They played her honor and her bravery like a fiddle, swine plucking at a violin.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re defending her.” The scientist’s wry smile mocked. “Yet in that poem you wrote about her—amazing, someone <span class="italic">memorizing</span> their own work, so they could recite it!—you depict her as a tavern slut, much older than she in fact was, a liar about her so-called voices, a superstitious but shrewd fool. The greatest enemy of the chastity she pretends to defend is a donkey—a donkey with wings!”</span></p><a id="page129"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire smiled. “A brilliant metaphor for the Roman Church, <span class="italic">n’est ce pas</span>? I had a point to make. She was simply the sword with which I drove it home. I had not met her then. I had no idea she was a woman of such mysterious depths.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not depths of intellect. A peasant!” Marq recalled how he had escaped just such a fate on the mud-grubbing world Biehleur. All through the Greys exam. And now he had fled their stodgy routines, into a true cultural revolution.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, no. Depths of the soul. I’m like a little stream. Clear because it is shallow. But she’s a river, an ocean! Return me to <span class="italic">Aux Deux Magots.</span> She and the wind-up <span class="italic">garçon</span> are the only society I now have.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“She is your adversary,” the scientist said. “A minion of those who uphold values that you fought all your life. To make sure you beat her, I’m going to supplement you.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I am intact and entire,” Voltaire declared frostily.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ll equip you with philosophical and scientific information, rational progress. Your reason must crush her faith. You must regard her as the enemy she is, if civilization is to continue to advance along rational scientific lines.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His eloquence and impudence were rather charming, but no substitutes for Voltaire’s fascination with Joan. “I refuse to read anything until you reunite me with the Maid—in the café!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The scientist had the audacity to laugh. “You don’t get it. You have no choice. I’ll sculpt the information into you. You’ll have the information you need to win, like it or not.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You violate my integrity!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Let’s not forget that after the debate, there’ll be the question of keeping you running, or…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ending me?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Just so you know what cards are on the table.”</span></p><a id="page130"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire bristled. He knew the iron accents of authority, since he was first subjected to his father’s—a strict martinet who’d compelled him to attend mass, and whose austerities claimed the life of Voltaire’s mother when Voltaire was only seven. The only way she could escape her husband’s discipline was to die. Voltaire had no intention of escaping this scientist in that way.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I refuse to <span class="italic">use</span> any additional knowledge you give me unless you return me at once to the café.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Infuriatingly, the scientist regarded Voltaire the way Voltaire had regarded his wigmaker—with haughty superiority. His curled lip said quite clearly that he knew Voltaire could not exist without his patronage.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A humbling turnabout. Though middle-class in origin himself, Voltaire did not believe common people worthy of governing themselves. The thought of his wigmaker posing as a legislator was enough to make him never wear a wig again. To be seen similarly by this vexing, smug scientist was intolerable.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Tell you what,” said the scientist. “You compose one of your brilliant <span class="italic">lettres philosophiques</span> trashing the concept of the human soul, and I will reunite you with the Maid. But if you don’t, you won’t see her until the day of the debate. Clear?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire mulled the offer over. “Clear as a little stream,” he said at last.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>—and then clotted, cinder-dark clouds descended into his mind. Memories, sullen and grim. He felt engulfed in a past that roared through him, scouring—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He’s cycling! There’s something surfacing here…” came Marq’s hollow call.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Images of the far past exploded.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Call Seldon! This sim has another layer! Call Seldon!”</span></p>
