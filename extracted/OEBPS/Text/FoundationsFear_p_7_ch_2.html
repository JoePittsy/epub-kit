      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>If Buta Fyrnix had begun as a grain of sand in his shoe, she was now a boulder.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“She’s impossible! Yak, yak, yak. Look,” he said to Dors when they were at last alone, “I only came to Sark because of psychohistory, not for Imperial backslapping. How did the social dampers fail here? What social mechanism slipped, allowing this raucous Renaissance of theirs?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My Hari, I fear that you do not have the nose to sniff out trends from life itself. It presses in on you. Data is more your province.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Granted. It’s unsettling, all this ferment! But I’m still interested in how they recovered those old simulations. If I could get out of taking tours of their ‘Renaissance,’ through noisy streets—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I quite agree,” Dors said mildly. “Tell them you want to do some work. We’ll stay in our rooms. I’m concerned about someone tracking us here. We’re just one worm-jump away from Panucopia.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ll need to access my office files. A quick wormlink to Trantor—”</span></p><a id="page466"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, you can’t work using a link. Lamurk could trace that easily.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But I haven’t the records—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’ll have to make do.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari stared out at the view, which he had to admit was spectacular. Great, stretching vistas. Riotous growth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But more fires boiled up on the horizon. There was gaiety in the streets of Sarkonia—and anger as well. The laboratories seethed with fresh energies, innovation bristled everywhere, the air seemed to sing with change and chaos.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His predictions were statistical, abstract. To see them coming true so quickly was sobering. He did not like the swift, turbulent feel to this place at all—even if he did understand it. For now.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The extremes of wealth and destitution were appalling. Change brought that, he knew.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>On Helicon he had seen poverty—and lived it, too. As a boy, his grandmother had insisted on buying him a raincoat several sizes too large, “to get more use out of it.” His mother didn’t like him playing kickball because he wore out his shoes too quickly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Here on Sark, as on Helicon, the truly poor were off in the hinterlands. Sometimes they couldn’t even afford fossil fuels. Men and women peered over a mule’s ass all day as it plodded down a furrow.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Some in his own family had fled the hardscrabble life for assembly lines. A generation or two after that, factory workers had scraped together enough money to buy a commercial driver’s license. Hari remembered his uncles and aunts accumulating injuries, just as his father had. Not having money, the pain came back to them years later in busted joints and unfixed legs, injuries staying with them in a way that a Trantorian would find astonishing.</span></p><a id="page467"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Heliconians in run-down shacks had worked on farm machinery that was big, powerful, dangerous, and cost more than any of them would earn in a lifetime. Their lives were obscure, far from the ramparts of haughty Empire. When dead and gone, they left nothing but impalpable memory, the light ash of a butterfly wing incinerated in a forest fire.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In a stable society their pain would be less. His father had died while working overtime on a big machine. He had been wiped out the year before and was struggling to make a comeback.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Economic surge and ebb had killed his father, as surely as the steel ground-pounder had when it rolled over on him. The lurch of distant markets had <span class="italic">murdered</span>—and Hari had known then what he must do. That he would defeat uncertainty itself, find order in seeming discord. Psychohistory could <span class="italic">be,</span> and hold sway.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His father—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Academician!” Buta Fyrnix’s penetrating voice snatched him away from his thoughts.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Uh, that tour of the precincts. I, I really don’t feel—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh, that is not possible, I fear. A domestic disturbance, most unfortunate.” She hurried on. “I do want you to speak with our tiktok engineers. They have devised new autonomous tiktoks. They say they can maintain control using only three basic laws—imagine!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors could not mask her surprise. She opened her mouth, hesitated, closed it. Hari also felt alarm, but Buta Fyrnix went right on, bubbling over new ventures on the Sarkian horizon. Then her eyebrows lifted and she said brightly, “Oh, yes—I do have even more welcome news. An Imperial squadron has just come to call.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh?” Dors shot back. “Under whose command?”</span></p><a id="page468"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“A Ragant Divenex, sector general. I just spoke to him—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Damn!” Dors said. “He’s a Lamurk henchman.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re sure?” Hari asked. He knew her slight pause had been to consult her internal files.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors nodded. Buta Fyrnix said calmly, “Well, I am sure he will be honored to take you back to Trantor when you are finished with your visit here. Which we hope will not be soon, of—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He mentioned us?” Dors asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He asked if you were enjoying—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Damn!” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“A sector general commands all the wormlinks, if he wishes—yes?” Dors asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, I suppose so.” Fyrnix looked puzzled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We’re trapped,” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Fyrnix’s eyes widened in shock. “But surely you, a First Minister candidate, need fear no—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Quiet.” Dors silenced the woman with a stern glance. “At best this Divenex will bottle us up here.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“At worst, there will be an ‘accident,’ ” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Is there no other way to get off Sark?” Dors demanded of Fyrnix.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, I can’t recall—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Think!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Startled, Fyrnix said, “Well, of course, we do have privateers who at times use the wild worms, but—”</span></p>
