      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>The next day he got an education in the realities of Imperial politics.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You didn’t know the 3D scope was on you?” Yugo asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari watched the conversation with Lamurk replay on his office holo. He had fled to the University when the Imperial Specials started having trouble holding the media mob away from his apartment. They had called in reinforcements when they caught a team drilling an acoustic tap into the apartment from three<a id="page66"></a> layers above. Hari and Dors had gotten out with an escort through a maintenance grav drop.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, I didn’t. There was a lot going on.” He remembered his bodyguards accosting someone, checking and letting it pass. The 3D camera and acoustic tracker were so small that a media deputy could walk around with them under formal wear. Assassins used the same artful concealment. Bodyguards knew how to distinguish between the two.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yugo said with Dahlite savvy, “Gotta watch ’em, you gonna play in those leagues.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I appreciate the concern,” Hari said dryly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors tapped a finger to her lips. “I think you came over rather well.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I didn’t want to seem as though I were deliberately cutting up a majority leader from the High Council,” Hari said heatedly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But that’s what you <span class="italic">were</span> doin’,” Yugo said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I suppose, but at the time it seemed like polite…banter,” he finished lamely. Edited for 3D, it was a quick verbal Ping-Pong with razor blades instead of balls.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But you topped him at every exchange,” Dors observed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t even dislike him! He has done good things for the Empire.” He paused, thinking. “But it was…fun.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Maybe you do have a talent for this,” she said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’d rather not.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t think you have much choice,” Yugo said. “You’re gettin’ famous.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Fame is the accumulation of misunderstandings around a well-known name,” Dors said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari smiled. “Well put.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s from Eldonian the Elder, the longest-lived emperor. The only one of his clan to die of old age.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Makes the point,” Yugo said. “You gotta expect some stories, gossip, mistakes.”</span></p><a id="page67"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari shook his head angrily. “No! Look, we can’t let this extraneous matter distract us. Yugo, what about those bootleg personality constellations you ‘acquired’?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ve got ’em.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Machine translated? They will run?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yeah, but they take an awful lot of memory and running volume. I’ve tuned them some, but they need a bigger parallel-processing network than I can give them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors frowned. “I don’t like this. These aren’t just constellations, they’re <span class="italic">sims.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari nodded. “We’re doing research here, not trying to manufacture a superrace.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors stood and paced energetically. “The most ancient of taboos is against sims. Even personality constellations obey rigid laws!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course, ancient history. But—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Pre</span>history.” Her nostrils flared. “The prohibitions go back so far, there are no records of how they started—undoubtedly, from some disastrous experiments well before the Shadow Age.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s that?” Yugo asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The long time—we have no clear idea of how long it lasted, though certainly several millennia—before the Empire became coherent.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Back on Earth, you mean?” Yugo looked skeptical.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Earth is more legend than fact. But yes, the taboo could go back that far.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These are hopelessly constricted sims,” Yugo said. “They don’t know anything about our time. One is a religious fanatic for some faith I never heard of. The other’s a smartass writer. No danger to anybody, except maybe themselves.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors regarded Yugo suspiciously. “If they’re so narrow, why are they useful?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Because they can calibrate psychohistorical<a id="page68"></a> indices. We have modeling equations that depend on basic human perceptions. If we have a pre-ancient mind, even simmed, we can calibrate the missing constants in the rate equations.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors snorted doubtfully. “I don’t follow the mathematics, but I know sims are dangerous.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Look, nobody savvy believes that stuff any more,” Yugo said. “Mathists have been running pseudo-sims for ages. Tiktoks—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Those are incomplete personalities, correct?” Dors asked severely.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, yeah, but—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We could get into very big trouble if these sims are better, more versatile.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yugo waved away her point with his large hands, smiling lazily. “Don’t worry. I got them all under control. Anyway, I’ve already got a way to solve our problem of getting enough running volume, machine time—<span class="italic">and</span> I’ve got a cover for us.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari arched his eyebrows. “What’s this?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ve got a customer for the sims. Somebody who’ll run them, cover all expenses, and pay for the privilege. Wants to use them for commercial purposes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Who?” Hari and Dors asked together.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Artifice Associates,” Yugo said triumphantly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari looked blank. Dors paused as though searching for a distant memory, and then said, “A firm engaged in computer systems architecture.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Right, one of the best. They’ve got a market for old sims as entertainment.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari said, “Never heard of them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yugo shook his head in amazement. “You don’t keep up, Hari.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t try to keep up. I try to stay ahead.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors said, “I don’t like using any outside agency. And what’s this about paying?”</span></p><a id="page69"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Yugo beamed. “They’re paying for license rights. I negotiated it all.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Do we have any control over how they use the sims?” Dors leaned forward alertly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We don’t need any,” Yugo said defensively. “They’ll probably use them in advertisements or something. How much use can you get out of a sim nobody will probably understand?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t like it. Aside from the commercial aspects, it’s risky to even revive an ancient sim. Public outrage—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hey, that’s the past. People don’t feel that way about tiktoks, and they’re getting pretty smart.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Tiktoks were machines of low mental capacity, held rigorously beneath an intelligence ceiling by the Encoding Laws of antiquity. Hari had always suspected that the true, ancient robots had made those laws, so that the realm of machine intelligence did not spawn ever more specialized and unpredictable types.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The true robots, such as R. Daneel Olivaw, remained aloof, cool, and long-visioned. But in the gathering anxieties across the entire Empire, traditional cybernetic protocols were breaking down. Like everything else.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors stood. “I’m opposed. We must stop this at once.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yugo rose too, startled. “You helped me find the sims. Now you—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I did not intend this.” Her face tightened.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari wondered at her intensity. Something else was at stake here, but what? He said mildly, “I see no reason to not make a bit of profit from side avenues of our research. And we do need increased computing capacity.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors’ mouth worked with irritation, but she said nothing more. Hari wondered why she was so<a id="page70"></a> opposed. “Usually you don’t give a damn about social conventions.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She said acidly, “Usually you are not a candidate for First Minister.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I will not let such considerations deflect our research,” he said firmly. “Understand?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She nodded and said nothing. He instantly felt like an overbearing tyrant. There was always a potential conflict between being coworkers and lovers. Usually they waltzed around the problems. Why was she so adamant?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They got through some more work on psychohistory, and Dors mentioned his next appointment. “She’s from my history department. I asked her to look into patterns in Trantorian trends over the last ten millennia.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh, good, thanks. Could you show her in, please?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sylvin Thoranax was a striking woman, bearing a box of old data pyramids. “I found these in a library halfway around the planet,” she explained.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari picked one up. “I’ve never seen one of these. Dusty!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For some there’s no library index. I down-coded a few and they’re good, still readable with a translation matrix.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ummm.” Hari liked the musty feel of old technology from simpler times. “We can read these directly?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She nodded. “I know how the reduced Seldon Equations function. You should be able to do a mat comparison and find the coefficients you need.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari grimaced. “They’re not my equations; they come out of a body of research by many—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Come come, Academician, everyone knows you wrote down the procedures, the approach.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari groused a little more, because it did irk him,<a id="page71"></a> but the Thoranax woman went on about using the pyramids and Yugo joined in enthusiastically and he let the point pass. She went off with Yugo to work and he settled into his usual academic grind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His daily schedule hovered on the holo:</span></p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="italic">Get Symposia speakers—sweeten the invitation for the reluctant</span></li>

        <li><span class="italic">Write nominations for Imperial Fellows</span></li>

        <li><span class="italic">Read student thesis, after it has been checked &amp; passed by Logic Chopper program</span></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="para"><span>These burned up the bulk of his day. Only when the Chancellor entered his office did he remember that he had promised to give a speech. The Chancellor had a quick, ironic smile and pursed lips, a reserved gaze—the scholar’s look. “Your…dress?” he asked pointedly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari fumbled in his office closet, fetched forth the balloon-sleeved and ample-girted robe, and changed in the side room. His secretary handed him his all-purpose view cube as they quickly left the office. With the Chancellor he crossed the main square, his Specials in an inconspicuous formation fore and aft. A crowd of well-dressed men and women trained 3D cameras at them, one panning up and down to get the full effect of the Streeling blue-and-yellow swirl-stripes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Have you heard from Lamurk?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What about the Dahlites?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Do you like the new Sector Principal? Does it matter that she’s a trisexualist?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How about the new health reports? Should the Emperor set exercise requirements for Trantor?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ignore them,” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Chancellor smiled and waved at the cameras. “They’re just doing their job.”</span></p><a id="page72"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s this about exercise?” Hari asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“A study found that electro-stim while sleeping doesn’t develop muscles as well as old-fashioned exercise.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not surprising.” He had worked in the fields as a boy and never liked the idea of having his exertion stimmed while he slept.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A wedge of reporters pressed nearer, shouting questions.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What does the Emperor think of what you said to Lamurk?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Is it true that your wife doesn’t want you to be First Minister?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What about Demerzel? Where is he?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What about the Zonal disputes? Can the Empire compromise?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A woman rushed forward. “How do you exercise?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari said sardonically, “I exercise restraint,” but his point sailed right past the woman, who looked at him blankly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As they entered the Great Hall, Hari remembered to fetch forth the view cube and hand it to the hall-master. A few 3Ds always made a talk pass more easily. “Big crowd,” he noted to the Chancellor as they took their places on the speech balcony above the bowl of seats.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Attendance is compulsory. All class members are here.” The Chancellor beamed down at the multitude. “I wanted to be sure we looked good to the reporters outside.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari’s mouth twisted. “How do they take attendance?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Everyone has a keyed seat. Once they sit, they’re counted, if their inboard ID matches the seat index.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“A lot of trouble just to get people to attend.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They must! It’s for their own good. And ours.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They’re adults, or else why let them study<a id="page73"></a> advanced subjects? Let them decide what’s good for them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Chancellor’s lips compressed as he rose to do the introduction. When Hari got up to talk, he said, “Now that you’re officially counted, I thank you for inviting me, and announce that this is the end of my formal address.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A rustle of surprise. Hari’s gaze swept the hall and he let the silence build. Then he said mildly, “I dislike speaking to anyone who has no choice over whether to listen. Now I shall sit down, and anyone wishing to leave may do so.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He sat. The auditorium buzzed. A few got up to leave. The other students booed them. When he rose to speak again they cheered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had never had an audience so on his side. He made the most of it, giving a ringing talk about the future of…mathematics. Not of the mortal Empire, but of beautiful, enduring mathematics.</span></p>
