      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“It’s about time,” Voltaire scolded Madame la Scientiste. She hung before him like an animated oil painting. He had chosen this representation, finding it oddly reassuring.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I haven’t been ignoring you on purpose,” she said, cool and businesslike.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How dare you slow me without my consent?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Marq and I are being besieged by media people. I never dreamed the Great Debate would be the media event of the decade. They all want a chance to interview you and Joan.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire fluffed the apricot ribbon at his throat. “I refuse to be seen by them without my powdered wig.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We’re not going to let them see you or the Maid at <span class="italic">all.</span> They can talk to Marq all they want. He likes attention and handles it well. He says public exposure will help his career.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I should think I would be consulted before such important decisions—”</span></p><a id="page139"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Look, I came as soon as my mechsec beeped me. I let you run on step-down time, to police up your pattern integration. You should be grateful that I give you interior time—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Contemplation?” he sniffed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That’s one way to look at it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I did not realize that such would have to be…<span class="italic">granted.</span>” Voltaire was in his richly appointed rooms at Frederick the Great’s court, playing chess with the friar whom he employed to let him win.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It costs. And cost/benefit analysis shows that it would be better if we ran you two together.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No solitude? It’s impossible to hold a rational conversation with the woman!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He turned his back on her, for maximum dramatic effect. He had been a fine actor—everyone who’d heard him perform in his plays at Frederick’s court said so. He knew a good scene when he saw one, and this one had dramatic potential. These creatures were <span class="italic">so</span> pallid, so unused to the gusts of raw emotion, artfully crafted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her voice softened. “Get rid of him and I’ll update you.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He turned and lifted a single thin finger at the good-natured friar, the only man of the cloth he had ever met whom he could stand. The man shuffled off, closing the carved oak door carefully.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire took a sip of Frederick’s fine sherry to clear his throat. “I want you to expunge the Maid’s memory of her final ordeal. It impedes our conversation, as surely as bishops and state officials impede the publication of intelligent work. Besides…” He paused, uncomfortable at expressing feelings softer than irritation. “…she’s suffering. I cannot bear to see it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t think—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And while you’re at it, obliterate from me, too,<a id="page140"></a> my memory of the eleven months I served in the Bastille. And all my frequent flights from Paris—not the flights themselves, mind you—my periods of exile constitute most of my life! Just delete their causes, not the effects.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, I don’t know—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He slammed a fist down on an ornately wrought oak side table. “Unless you liberate me from past fears, I cannot act freely!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Simple logic—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Since when is logic simple? I cannot ‘simply’ compose my <span class="italic">lettre philosophique</span> on the absurdity of denying those like Garçon 213-ADM the rights of man on the grounds that they have no soul. He’s an amusing little fellow, don’t you think? And as smart as at least a dozen priests whom I have known. Does he not speak? Respond? Desire? He is infatuated with a human cook. Should he not be able to pursue happiness as freely as you or I? If he has no soul, then you have no soul, either. If you have a soul, it can only be inferred from your behavior, and since we may make the identical inference from the behavior of Garçon, so does he.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m inclined to agree,” Madame la Scientiste said. “Though of course 213-ADM’s reactions are simulations. Self-aware machines have been illegal for millennia.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That is what I challenge!” Voltaire shouted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And how much of that comes from Sarkian programming?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“None. The rights of man—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hardly need apply to machines.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire scowled. “I cannot express myself completely freely on these sensitive matters—unless you rid me of the memory of what I suffered for expressing my ideas.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But your past is your self. Without all of it, intact—”</span></p><a id="page141"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nonsense! The truth is, I never <span class="italic">dared</span> express myself freely on many matters. Take that life-hating Puritan Pascal, his views of original sin, miracles, and much other nonsense besides. I didn’t dare say what I really thought! Always, I had to calculate what every assault on convention and traditional stupidity would cost.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Madame la Scientiste pursed her lips prettily. “You did well enough, I would guess. You were famous. We don’t know your history, or even your world. But from your memories I can tell—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And the Maid! She is thwarted more than I! For <span class="italic">her</span> convictions, she paid the ultimate price. Being crucified could be no worse than what she suffered at the stake. Light a goodly pipe—as I love to do—before her, and her eyes roll with confusion.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But that’s crucial to who she <span class="italic">is.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Rational inquiries cannot be carried out in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. If our contest is to be fair, I implore you, rid us of these terrors that prevent us from speaking our minds and from encouraging others to speak theirs. Else this debate will be like a race run with bricks tied to the runners’ ankles.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Madame la Scientiste did not respond at once. “I—I’d like to help, but I’m not sure I can.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire spluttered with scorn. “I know enough of your procedures to know you can comply with my request.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That poses no problem, true. But morally, I’m not at liberty to tamper with the Maid’s program at whim.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire stiffened. “I realize Madame has a low opinion of my philosophy, but surely—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not so! I think the world of you! You have a modern mind, and from the depths of the dark past—astonishing. I wish the Empire had men like you! But<a id="page142"></a> your point of view, though valid as far as it goes, is limited because of what it leaves out and cannot address.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">My</span> philosophy? It embraces all, a universal view—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">And</span> I work for Artifice Associates and the Preservers, for Mr. Boker. I’m bound by ethics to give them the Maid they want. Unless I could convince them to delete the Maid’s memory of her martyrdom, I can’t do it. And Marq would have to get permission from the company and the Skeptics to delete yours. He’d love to, I assure you. His Skeptics are more likely to consent than my Preservers. It would give you an advantage.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I quite agree,” he conceded at once. “Relieving me of my burdens without ridding the Maid of hers would not be rational or ethical. Neither Locke nor Newton would approve.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Madame la Scientiste did not answer at once. “I’ll talk to my boss and to Monsieur Boker,” she said at last. “But I wouldn’t hold my breath if I were you.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire smiled wryly and said, “Madame forgets I have no breath to hold.”</span></p>
