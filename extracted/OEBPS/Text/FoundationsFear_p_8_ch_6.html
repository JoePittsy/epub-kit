      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Voltaire shouted proudly, “I spent much of my career exiled for speaking Truth to Power. I’ll admit to some flaws in judgment, as when I fawned over Frederick the Great. Necessity shapes manners, I’ll remind you. I was courageous, yes—but snobbish, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[THOUGH A MATHEMATICAL REPRESENTATION]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOU SHARE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS OF YOUR KIND]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[STILL]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course!” Joan shouted in his defense.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOUR KIND ARE THE WORST OF ALL VIVIFORMS]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Living things?” Joan frowned. “But they are of holy origin.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOUR KIND IS A PERNICIOUS BLEND]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[A TERRIBLE MARRIAGE OF MECHANISM]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WITH YOUR BEAST URGE TO EXPAND]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You can see our inner structures as surely as we.” Voltaire swelled, popping with energies. “Probably better, I’ll venture. You must know that for us, consciousness reigns; it does not govern.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[PRIMITIVE AND AWKWARD]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[TRUE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[BUT NOT THE CAUSE OF YOUR SIN]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She and Voltaire were giants now, self-ballooned to stride across the simulated landscape. The alien fogs clung to their ankles. A proud way of showing their courage, perhaps, a bit full of self. Still, she was glad she had thought of it. These fogs held humanity in contempt. A show of force was useful, as she had found against the vile English several times.</span></p><a id="page528"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire said, “I held Power in contempt, usually, yet I’ll admit I was everlastingly hungry for it, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[THE SIGNATURE OF YOUR KIND]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So I am a contradiction! Humanity is a rope stretched between paradoxes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE DO NOT FIND YOUR HUMANITY MORAL]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But we—they—are!” Joan shouted down at the fog. Though thin compared with them, the fogs clung like glue and filled the valleys with cottony gum.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOU DO NOT KNOW YOUR OWN HISTORY]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We are <span class="italic">of</span> history!” Voltaire boomed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[THE RECORDS HERE IN THE MATHEMATICAL SPACES]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[ARE FALSE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“One can never be sure of being read right, you know.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan saw in Voltaire an anxiety barely concealed. Though their opponent used a voice cool and dispassionate, she too felt the insidious threat in its cast of words.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire went on, as if to please a king in court, “A bit of historical example. I once saw in a churchyard in England, there to hail the bright Newton, a headstone, thus:</span></p>

      <p class="paraCenter1"><span>ERECTED TO THE MEMORY</span></p>

      <p class="paraCenter"><span>of John McFarlane</span></p>

      <p class="paraCenter"><span>Drown’d in the Water of Leith</span></p>

      <p class="paraCenter2"><span>BY A FEW AFFECTIONATE FRIENDS</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So you see, there can be mistakes of translation.” He lifted his elaborate courtier’s hat and made a sweeping bow. The hat’s plumed feather danced in a fresh wind. Joan saw that he was distracting the fog while trying to subtly blow it away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The fogs flashed orange lightning and swelled,<a id="page529"></a> enormous and purple. Thunderheads rose and towered above them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire showed only an arch scorn. She had to admire his gait as he whirled and confronted the gargantuan purple cloud-mountain. She remembered how he had waxed on about his dramatic triumphs, his legions of acclaimed plays, his popularity at court. As if to show off for her, he curled a lip into a sneer and invented a poem for the moment:</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Big whorls have little whorls</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Which feed on their velocity,</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And little whorls have lesser whorls,</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And so on to viscosity.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The cloud hurled savage sheets of rain down upon them. Joan was instantly drenched and chilled to the bone. Voltaire’s glorious garb wilted. His face turned blue with cold.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Enough!” he cried. “Pity the poor woman at least.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I need no pity!” Joan was genuinely outraged. “And you’ll not show weakness before the enemy legions.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He managed a jaunty smile. “I defer to the general of my heart.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOU LIVE ONLY AT OUR WILL]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Pray, do not spare us out of pity then,” Joan said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOU LIVE SOLELY BECAUSE ONE OF YOU]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[SHOWED MORAL SELF]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[TO ONE OF OUR LOWER FORMS]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan was puzzled. “Who?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOU]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Beside her materialized Garçon 213-ADM.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But this is surely a multiply-removed entity,” Voltaire snapped. “<span class="italic">And</span> a servant.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan patted Garçon. “A simulation of a machine?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE WERE ONCE OF MACHINE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[AND HAVE COME HERE TO DWELL]</span></p><a id="page530"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>[IN NUMERICAL EMBODIMENT]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“From where?” Joan asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[ACROSS ALL THE TURNING SPIRAL DISK]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[REMEMBER:]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[PUNISHMENT DETERS BY LENDING CREDENCE TO THREAT]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire asked, “So you said before. Taking the long view, eh? But what do you truly want <span class="italic">now</span>?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE TOO DESCEND FROM VIVIFORMS NOW EXTINGUISHED]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[DO NOT IMAGINE WE ARE FREE OF THAT]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan felt a horrible suspicion. She whispered, “Do not provoke it so! It might—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I would know the truth. What do you want?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[REVENGE]</span></p>
