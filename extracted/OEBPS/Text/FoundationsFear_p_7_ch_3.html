      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>In Hari’s studies he had discovered a curious little law. Now he turned it in his favor.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Bureaucracy increases as a doubling function in<a id="page469"></a> time, given the resources. At the personal level, the cause was the persistent desire of every manager to hire at least one assistant. This provided the time constant for growth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Eventually this collided with the carrying capacity of society. Given the time constant and the capacity, one could predict a plateau level of bureaucratic overhead—or else, if growth persisted, the date of collapse. Predictions of the longevity of bureaucracy-driven societies fit a precise curve. Surprisingly, the same scaling laws worked for microsocieties such as large agencies.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The corpulent Imperial bureaus on Sark could not move swiftly. Sector General Divenex’s squadron had to stay in planetary space, since it was paying a purely formal visit. Niceties were still observed. Divenex did not want to use brute force when a waiting game would work.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I see. That gives us a few days,” Dors concluded.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari nodded. He had done the required speaking, negotiating, dealing, promising favors—all activities he disliked intensely. Dors had done the background digging. “To…?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Train.”</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Wormholes were labyrinths, not mere tunnels with two ends. The large ones held firm for perhaps billions of years—none larger than a hundred meters across had yet collapsed. The smallest could sometimes last only hours, at best a year. In the thinner worms, flexes in the wormwalls <span class="italic">during</span> passage could alter the end point of a traveler’s trajectory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Worse, worms in their last stages spawned transient, doomed young—the wild worms. As deformations in space-time, supported by negative energy-density “struts,” wormholes were inherently<a id="page470"></a> rickety. As they failed, smaller deformations twisted away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sark had seven wormholes. One was dying. It hung a light-hour away, spitting out wild worms that ranged from a hand’s-width size, up to several meters.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A fairly sizable wild worm had sprouted out of the side of the dying worm several months before. The Imperial squadron did not know of this, of course. All worms were taxed, so a free wormhole was a bonanza. Reporting their existence, well, often a planet simply didn’t get around to that until the wild worm had fizzled away in a spray of subatomic surf.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Until then, pilots carried cargo through them. That wild worms could evaporate with only seconds’ warning made their trade dangerous, highly paid, and legendary.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Wormriders were the sort of people who as children liked to ride their bicycles no-handed, but with a difference—they rode off rooftops.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>By an odd logic, that kind of child grew up and got trained and even paid taxes—but inside, they stayed the same.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Only risk takers could power through the chaotic flux of a transient worm and take the risks that worked, <span class="italic">not</span> take those that didn’t, and live. They had elevated bravado to its finer points.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This wild worm, it’s tricky,” a grizzled woman told Hari and Dors. “No room for a pilot if you both go.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We must stay together,” Dors said with finality.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Then you’ll have to pilot.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We don’t know how,” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re in luck.” The lined woman grinned without humor. “This wildy’s short, easy.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What are the risks?” Dors demanded stiffly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m not an insurance agent, lady.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I insist that we know—”</span></p><a id="page471"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Look, lady, we’ll teach you. That’s the deal.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I had hoped for a more—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Give it a rest, or it’s no deal at all.”</span></p>
