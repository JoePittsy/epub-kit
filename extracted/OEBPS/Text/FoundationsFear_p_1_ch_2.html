      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Walking through the Imperial Gardens, Hari wished Dors was with him. He recalled her wariness over his coming again to the attention of Cleon. “They’re crazy, often,” she had said in a dispassionate voice. “The gentry are eccentric, which allows emperors to be bizarre.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You exaggerate,” he had responded.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Dadrian the Frugal always urinated in the Imperial Gardens,” she had answered. “He would leave state functions to do it, saying that it saved his subjects a needless expense in water.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had to suppress a laugh; palace staff were undoubtedly studying him. He regained his sober manner by admiring the ornate, towering trees, sculpted in the Spindlerian style of three millennia before. He felt the tug of such natural beauty, despite his years buried in Trantor. Here, verdant wealth stretched up toward the blazing sun like outstretched arms. This was the only open spot on the<a id="page16"></a> planet, and it reminded him of Helicon, where he had begun.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had been a rather dreamy boy in a laboring district of Helicon. The work in fields and factories was easy enough that he could think his own shifting, abstract musings while he did it. Before the Civil Service exams changed his life, he had worked out a few simple theorems in number theory and later was crushed to find that they were already known. He lay in bed at night thinking of planes and vectors and trying to envision dimensions larger than three, listening to the distant bleat of the puff-dragons who came drifting down the mountain sides in search of prey. Bioengineered for some ancient purpose, probably hunting, they were revered beasts. He had not seen one for many years….</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Helicon, the wild—that was what he longed for. But his destiny seemed submerged in Trantor’s steel.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari glanced back and his Specials, thinking they were summoned, trotted forward. “No,” he said, his hands pushing air toward them—a gesture he was making all the time these days, he reflected. Even in the Imperial Gardens they acted as though every gardener was a potential assassin.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had come this way, rather than simply emerge from the grav lifter inside the palace, because he liked the gardens above all else. In the distant haze a wall of trees towered, coaxed upward by genetic engineering until they obscured the ramparts of Trantor. Only here, on all the planet, was it possible to experience something resembling the out of doors.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>What an arrogant term! Hari thought. To define all of creation by its lying outside the doorways of humanity.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His formal shoes crunched against gravel as he left the sheltered walkways and mounted the formal<a id="page17"></a> ramp. Beyond the forested perimeter rose a plume of black smoke. He slowed and estimated distance, perhaps ten klicks. Some major incident, surely.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Striding between tall, neopantheonic columns, he felt a weight descend. Attendants dashed out to welcome him, his Specials tightened up behind, and they made a little procession through the long corridors leading to the Vault of Audience. Here the accumulated great artworks of millennia crowded each other, as if seeking a constituency in the present to give them life.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The heavy hand of the Imperium lay upon most official art. The Empire was essentially about the past, its solidity, and so expressed its taste with a preference for the pretty. Emperors favored the clean straight lines of ascending slabs, the exact parabolas of arcing purple water fountains, classical columns and buttresses and arches. Heroic sculpture abounded. Noble brows eyed infinite prospects. Colossal battles stood frozen at climactic moments, shaped in glowing stone and holoid crystal.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>All were entirely proper and devoid of embarrassing challenge. No alarming art here, thank you. Nothing “disturbing” was even allowed in public places on Trantor which the Emperor might visit. By exporting to the periphs all hint of the unpleasantness and smell of human lives, the Imperium achieved its final state, the terminally bland.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yet to Hari, the reaction against blandness was worse. Among the galaxy’s twenty-five million inhabited planets endless variations appeared, but there simmered beneath the Imperial blanket a style based solely on rejection.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Particularly among those Hari termed “chaos worlds,” a smug avant-garde fumbled for the sublime by substituting for beauty a love of terror, shock, and the sickeningly grotesque. They used enormous<a id="page18"></a> scale, or acute disproportion, or scatology, or discord and irrational disjunction.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Both approaches were boring. Neither had any airy joy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A wall dissolved, crackling, and they entered the Vault of Audience. Attendants vanished, his Specials fell behind. Abruptly Hari was alone. He padded over the cushiony floor. Baroque excess leered at him from every raised cornice, upjutting ornament, and elaborate wainscoting.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Silence. The Emperor was never waiting for anyone, of course. The gloomy chamber gave back no echoes, as though the walls absorbed everything.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Indeed, they probably did. No doubt every Imperial conversation went into several ears. There might be eavesdroppers halfway across the Galaxy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A light, moving. Down a crackling grav column came Cleon. “Hari! So happy you could come.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Since refusing a summons by the Emperor was traditionally grounds for execution, Hari could barely suppress a wry smile. “My honor to serve, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Come, sit.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon moved heavily. Rumor had it that his appetite, already legendary, had begun to exceed even the skills of his cooks and physicians. “We have much to discuss.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Emperor’s constant attendant glow served to subtly enhance him with its nimbus. The contrast was mild, serving to draw him out from a comparative surrounding gloom. The room’s embedded intelligences tracked his eyes and shed added light where his gaze fell, again with delicate emphasis, subtly applied. The soft touch of his regard yielded a radiance which guests scarcely noticed, but which acted subconsciously, adding to their awe. Hari knew this, yet the effect still worked; Cleon looked masterful, regal.</span></p><a id="page19"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“I fear we have hit a snag,” Cleon said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nothing you cannot master, I am sure, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon shook his head wearily. “Now don’t you, too, go on about my prodigious powers. Some…elements—” he drew the word out with dry disdain “—object to your appointment.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I see.” Hari kept his face blank, but his heart leaped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Do not be glum! I <span class="italic">do</span> want you for my First Minister.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But I am not, despite commonplace assumption, utterly free to act.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I realize that many others are better qualified—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“In their own eyes, surely.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“—and better trained, and—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And know nothing of psychohistory.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Demerzel exaggerated the utility of psychohistory.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nonsense. He suggested your name to me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You know as well as I that he was exhausted, not in his best frame of—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“His judgment was impeccable for decades.” Cleon eyed Hari. “One would almost think you were trying to avoid appointment as First Minister.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, sire, but—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Men—and women, for that matter—have killed for far less.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And been killed, once they got it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon chuckled. “True enough. Some First Ministers do get self-important, begin to scheme against their Emperor—but let us not dwell upon the few failures of our system.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari recalled Demerzel saying, “The succession of crises has reached the point where the consideration of the Three Laws of Robotics paralyzes me.” Demerzel had been unable to make choices because<a id="page20"></a> there were no good ones left. Every possible move hurt someone, badly. So Demerzel, a supreme intelligence, a clandestine humaniform robot, had suddenly left the scene. What chance did Hari have?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I will assume the position, of course,” Hari said quietly, “if necessary.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh, it’s necessary. If <span class="italic">possible,</span> you mean. Factions on the High Council oppose you. They demand a full discussion.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari blinked, alarmed. “Will I have to debate?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“—and then a vote.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I had no idea the Council could intervene.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Read the Codes. They do have that power. Typically they do not use it, bowing to the superior wisdom of the Emperor.” A dry little laugh. “Not this time.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“If it would make it easier for you, I could absent myself while the discussion—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nonsense! I want to use you to counter them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I haven’t any ideas how to—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ll scent out the issues; you advise me on answers. Division of labor, nothing could be simpler.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Um.” Demerzel had said confidently, “If he believes you have the psychohistorical answer, he will follow you eagerly and that will make you a good First Minister.” Here, in such august surroundings, that seemed quite unlikely.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We will have to evade these opponents, maneuver against them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I have no idea how to do that.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course you do not! I do. But you see the Empire and all its history as one unfurling scroll. You have the <span class="italic">theory.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon relished ruling. Hari felt in his bones that he did not. As First Minister, his word could determine the fate of millions. That had daunted even Demerzel.</span></p><a id="page21"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“There is still the Zeroth Law,” Demerzel had said just before they parted for the last time. It placed the well-being of humanity as a whole above that of any single human. The First Law then read, <span class="italic">A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate the Zeroth Law.</span> Fair enough, but how was Hari to carry out a job which not even Demerzel could do? Hari realized that he had been silent for too long, and that Cleon was waiting. What could he say?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Um, who opposes me?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Several factions united behind Betan Lamurk.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s his objection?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To his surprise, the Emperor laughed heartily. “That you aren’t Betan Lamurk.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You can’t simply—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Overrule the Council? Offer Lamurk a deal? Buy him off?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I didn’t mean to imply, sire, that you would stoop to—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course I would ‘stoop,’ as you put it. The difficulty lies with Lamurk himself. His price to allow you in as First Minister would be too high.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Some high position?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That, and some estates, perhaps an entire Zone.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Turning an entire Zone of the Galaxy over to a single man…“High stakes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon sighed. “We are not as rich, these days. In the reign of Fletch the Furious, he bartered whole Zones simply for seats on the Council.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Your supporters, the Royalists, they can’t outmaneuver Lamurk?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You really must study current politics more, Seldon. Though I suppose you’re so steeped in history, all this seems a bit trivial?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Actually, Hari thought, he was steeped in mathematics.<a id="page22"></a> Dors supplied the history he needed, or Yugo. “I will do so. So the Royalists—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Have lost the Dahlites, so they cannot muster a majority coalition.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Dahlites are that powerful?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They have an argument popular with a broad audience, plus a large population.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I did not know they were so strong. My own close assistant, Yugo—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I know, a Dahlite. Watch him.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari blinked. “Yugo is a strong Dahlite, true. But he is loyal, a fine, intuitive mathist. But how did you—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Background check.” Cleon waved his hand in airy dismissal. “One must know a few things about a First Minister.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari disliked being under an Imperial microscope, but he kept his face blank. “Yugo is loyal to me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I know the story, how you uplifted him from hard labor, bypassing the Civil Service filters. Very noble of you. But I cannot overlook the fact that the Dahlites have a ready audience for their fevered outpourings. They threaten to alter the representation of Sectors in the High Council, even in the Lower Council. So—” Cleon jabbed a finger “—watch him.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, sire.” Cleon was getting steamed up about nothing, as far as Yugo was concerned, but no point in arguing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You will have to be as circumspect as the Emperor’s wife during this, ah, transitional period.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari recalled the ancient saying, that above all the Emperor’s wife (or wives, depending upon the era) must keep her skirts clean, no matter what muck she walks above. The analogy was used even when the Emperor proved to be homosexual, or even when a woman held the Imperial Palace. “Yes, sire. Uh, ‘transitional’…?”</span></p><a id="page23"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon looked off in a distracted way at the towering, shadowy art forms looming around them. By now Hari understood that this pointed to the crux of why he had been summoned. “Your appointment will take a while, as the High Council fidgets. So I shall seek your advice…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Without giving me the power.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, yes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari felt no disappointment. “So I can stay in my office at Streeling?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I suppose it would seem forward if you came here.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Good. Now, about those Specials—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">They</span> must remain with you. Trantor is more dangerous than a professor knows.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari sighed. “Yes, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon lounged back, his airchair folding itself about him elaborately. “Now I would like your advice on this Renegatum matter.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Renegatum?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>For the first time, Hari saw Cleon show surprise. “You have not followed the case? It is everywhere!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I am a bit out of the main stream, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Renegatum—the Society of Renegades. They kill and destroy.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For what?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For the pleasure of destruction!” Cleon slapped his chair angrily and it responded by massaging him, apparently a standard answer. “The latest of their members to ‘demonstrate their contempt for society’ is a woman named Kutonin. She invaded the Imperial Galleries, torch-melted art many millennia old, and killed two guards. Then she peacefully turned herself over to the officers who arrived.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You shall have her executed?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course. Court decided she was guilty quickly enough—she confessed.”</span></p><a id="page24"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Readily?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Immediately.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Confession under the subtle ministrations of the Imperials was legendary. Breaking the flesh was easy enough; the Imperials broke the suspect’s psyche, as well. “So sentence can be set by you, it being a high crime against the Imperium.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh yes, that old law about rebellious vandalism.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It allows the death penalty and any special torture.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But death is not enough! Not for the Renegatum crimes. So I turn to my psychohistorian.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You want me to…?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Give me an idea. These people <span class="italic">say</span> they’re doing it to bring down the existing order and all that, of course. But they get immense planet-wide coverage, their names known by everyone as the destroyers of time-honored art. They go to their graves <span class="italic">famous.</span> All the psychers say that’s their real motivation. I can kill them, but they don’t care by that time!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Um,” Hari said uncomfortably. He knew full well he could never comprehend such people.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So give me an idea. Something psychohistorical.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was intrigued by the problem, but nothing came to mind. He had long ago learned to deliberately not concentrate on a vexing question immediately, letting his subconscious have first crack. To gain time he asked, “Sire, you saw the smoke beyond the gardens?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Um? No.” Cleon gave a quick hand signal to unseen eyes and the far wall blossomed with light. A full holo of the gardens filled the massive space. The oily black plume had grown. It coiled snakelike into the gray sky.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A soft, neutral voice spoke in midair. “A breakdown, with insurrection by mechanicals, has caused this unfortunate lapse in domestic order.”</span></p><a id="page25"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“A tiktok riot?” This sort of thing Hari had heard about.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon rose and walked toward the holo. “Ah yes, another recalcitrant riddle. For some reason the mechanicals are going awry. <span class="italic">Look</span> at that! How many levels are burning?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Twelve levels are aflame,” the autovoice answered. “Imperial Analysis estimates a death toll of four hundred thirty-seven, within an uncertainty of eighty-four.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Imperial cost?” Cleon demanded.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Minor. Some Imperial Regulars were hurt in subduing mechanicals.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah. Well then, it is a small matter.” Cleon watched as the wall close-upped. The view plunged down a smoking pit. To the side, like a blazing layer cake, whole floors curled up from the heat. Sparks shot between electrical boosters. Burst pipes showered the flames but had little effect.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then a distant view, telescoping up into orbit. The program was giving the Emperor an eyeful, showing off its capabilities. Hari guessed that it didn’t often get the chance. Cleon the Calm was one derisive nickname for him, for he seemed bored with most matters that moved men.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>From space, the only deep green was the Imperial Gardens—just a splotch amid the grays and browns of roofs and roof-agriculture. Charcoal-black solar collectors and burnished steel, pole to pole. The ice caps had dissipated long ago and the seas sloshed in underground cisterns.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Trantor supported forty billion people in a world-wrapping single city, seldom less than half a kilometer deep. Sealed, protected, its billions had long grown used to recycled air and short perspectives, and feared the open spaces a mere elevator ride away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The view zoomed down into the smoky pit again.<a id="page26"></a> Hari could see tiny figures leaping to their deaths to escape the flames. <span class="italic">Hundreds dying</span>…Hari’s stomach lurched. In crowded stacks of humanity, accidents took a fearsome toll.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Still, Hari calculated, there were on average only a hundred people in a square kilometer of the planet’s surface. People jammed into the more popular Sectors out of preference, not necessity. With the seas pumped below, there was ample room for automated factories, deep mines, and immense, cavernous growing pods, where raw materials for food emerged with little direct human labor needed. These wearisome chores the tiktoks did. But now they were bringing mayhem to the intricacy that was Trantor, and Cleon fumed as he watched the disaster grow, eating away whole layers with fiery teeth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>More figures writhed in the orange flames. These were <span class="italic">people,</span> not statistics, he reminded himself. Bile rose in his throat. To be a leader meant that sometimes you had to look away from the pain. Could he do that?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Another puzzle, my Seldon,” Cleon said abruptly. “Why do the tiktoks have these large-scale ‘disorders’ my advisers keep telling me about? Ah?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I do not—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There must be <span class="italic">some</span> psychohistorical explanation!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These tiny phenomena may well lie beyond—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Work on it! Find out!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Uh, yes, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari knew enough to let Cleon pad pointlessly around the vault, frowning at the continuing wall-high scenes of carnage, in utter silence. Perhaps, Hari thought, the Emperor was calm because he had seen so much calamity already. Even horrendous news palls. A sobering thought; would the same happen to the naïve Hari Seldon?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon had some way of dealing with disaster, though, for after a few moments he waved and the<a id="page27"></a> scenes vanished. The vault filled with cheerful music and the lighting rose. Attendants scampered out with bowls and trays of appetizers. A man at Hari’s elbow offered him a stim. Hari waved it away. The sudden shift in mood was heady enough. Apparently it was commonplace, though, for the Imperial Court.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had felt something tickling at the back of his mind for several minutes now, and the quiet moments had given him a chance to finally pay attention to it. As Cleon accepted a stim, he said hesitantly, “Sire, I—?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes? Have one, ah?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nossir, I, I had a thought about the Renegatum and the Kutonin woman.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh, my, I’d rather not think about—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Suppose you erase her identity.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon’s hand stopped with a stim halfway to his nose. “Ah?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They are willing to die, once they’ve attracted attention. They probably think they will live on, be famous. Take that away from them. Permit no release of their true names. In all media and official documents, give them an insulting name.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon frowned. “Another name…?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Call this Kutonin woman Moron One. The next one, Moron Two. Make it illegal by Imperial decree to ever refer to her any other way. Then she as a person vanishes from history. No fame.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon brightened. “Now, that’s an idea. I’ll try it. I not merely take their lives, I can take their <span class="italic">selves.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari smiled wanly as Cleon spoke to an adjutant, giving instructions for a fresh Imperial Decree. Hari hoped it would work, but in any case, it had gotten him off the hook. Cleon did not seem to notice that the idea had nothing to do with psychohistory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Pleased, he tried an appetizer. They were startlingly good.</span></p><a id="page28"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon beckoned to him. “Come, First Minister, I have some people for you to meet. They might prove useful, even to a mathist.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I am honored.” Dors had coached him on a few homilies to use when he could think of nothing to say and he trotted one out now. “Whatever would be useful in service to the people—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah, yes, the people,” Cleon drawled. “I hear <span class="italic">so</span> much about them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari realized that Cleon had spent a life listening to pat, predictable speeches. “Sorry, sire, I—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It reminds me of a poll result, assembled by my Trantorian specialists.” Cleon took an appetizer from a woman half his size. “They asked, ‘To what do you attribute the ignorance and apathy of the Trantorian masses?’ and the most common reply was ‘Don’t know and don’t care.’ ”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Only when Cleon laughed did Hari realize this was a joke.</span></p>
