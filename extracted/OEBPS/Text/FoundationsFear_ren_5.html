      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>R. Daneel gazed at Dors without expression, letting his body go slack.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors said, “We must defend him against Lamurk. You could reappear, come out in favor of him. As former First Minister, your public endorsement and support—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I cannot reappear as Eto Demerzel, ex-important person. That would compromise my other tasks.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But Hari <span class="italic">has</span> to have—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“As well, you mistake my power as Demerzel. I am now history. Lamurk will care nothing about me, for I have no legions to command.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors fumed silently. “But you <span class="italic">must</span>—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I shall move more of us into Lamurk’s inner circle.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s too late to infiltrate.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Daneel activated his expressive programs and smiled. “I planted several of our kind decades ago. They shall all be in position soon.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re using…us?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I must. Though your implication is correct: we are few.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I need help protecting him, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Quite right.” He produced a thick disk, this time from a compartment beneath his armpit. “This will identify the Lamurk agents for you.”</span></p><a id="page492"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>She looked doubtful. “How? This looks like a chem snooper.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I have agents of my own. They can in turn label Lamurk’s agents. This device will pick up their tags. Other encoded messages will ride on the marking signal.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And Lamurk’s specialists won’t pick up the tags?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This device uses methods lost for six millennia. Install it in your right arm, at station cut six. Interface with apertures two and five.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How will I—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Specs and expertise will flow to your long-term memory upon connection.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She installed the device as he watched. His grave presence made silence natural. Olivaw never wasted a movement or made idle conversation. Finally, intricacies done, she sighed and said, “He’s interested in those simulations, the ones which escaped.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He is following the best line of attack for psychohistory.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There’s this tiktok problem, too. Do you understand—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The social taboos against simulations inevitably break down during cultural resurgences,” Daneel said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So tiktoks—?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They are inherently destabilizing if they become too developed. After all, we cannot condone a new generation of robots, or the rediscovery of the positronic process.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There are signs in the historical record that this has happened before.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You are an insightful scholar.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There were only a few traces, but I suspect—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Suspect no further. You are correct. I could not expunge every scrap of data.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">You</span> disguised such events?”</span></p><a id="page493"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“And much else.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Why? As an historian—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I had to. Humanity is best served by Imperial stability. Tiktoks, sims—these accompany movements such as this ‘New Renaissance,’ feeding the fire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s to be done?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I do not know. Matters are slipping beyond my ability to predict.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She frowned. “How <span class="italic">do</span> you predict?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“In the first millennia of the Empire, our kind developed the simple theory I have mentioned before. Useful, but crude. It led me to expect the reemergence of these simulations as a side effect of the Sarkian ‘Renaissance’ and its turmoil.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Does Hari understand this?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hari’s psychohistory is vastly superior to our models. He lacks certain vital historical data, however. When it is eventually included, he will be able to accurately anticipate the Empire’s devolution.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You do not mean ‘evolution’?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Quite. That is a major reason why we devote such resources to helping Hari.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He is crucial.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course. Why do you think I assigned you to him?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Does it matter that I’ve fallen in love with him?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No. But it helps.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Helps me? Or him?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Daneel smiled thinly. “Both, I should hope. But mostly, it helps me.”</span></p>
