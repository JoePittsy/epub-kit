      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Ipan needed food and rest—if only to stop his heart from lurching at every minor sound. Sheelah and Ipan clutched each other, high in a tree, and crooned and petted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari needed time to think. Autoservers were keeping their bodies alive at the station. Dors’ tiktok would defend the locks, but how long would a security officer take to get around that?</span></p><a id="page412"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>It would be smart to let them stay out here, in danger, saying to the rest of the staff that the two odd tourists wanted a really long immersion. Let nature take its course.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His thinking triggered jitters in Ipan, so he dropped that mode. Better to think abstractly. There was plenty out here that needed understanding.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He suspected that the ancients who planted pans and gigantelope and the rest here had tinkered with the raboons, to see if they could turn a more distant primate relative into something like humans. A perverse goal, it seemed to Hari, but believable. Scientists loved to tinker.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They had gotten as far as pack-hunting, but raboons had no tools beyond crudely edged stones, occasionally used to cut meat once they had brought it down.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In another few million years, under evolution’s grind, they might be as smart as pans. Who would go extinct then?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>At the moment he didn’t much care. He had felt real rage when the pans—<span class="italic">his own kind!</span>—had turned against them, even when the raboons came within view. Why?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He worried at the issue, sure there was something here he had to understand. Psychohistory had to deal with such basic, fundamental impulses. The pans’ reaction had been uncomfortably close to myriad incidents in human history.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Hate the Stranger.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had to fathom that murky truth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Pans moved in small groups, disliking outsiders, breeding mostly within their modest circle of a few dozen. This meant any genetic trait that emerged could pass swiftly into all the members, through inbreeding. If it helped the band survive, the rough rub of chance would select for that band’s survival. Fair enough.</span></p><a id="page413"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>But the trait had to be undiluted. A troop of especially good rock throwers would get swallowed up if they joined a company of several hundred. Contact would make them breed outside the original small clan. Outbreeding: their genetic heritage would get watered down.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Striking a balance between the accidents of genetics in small groups, and the stability of large groups—that was the trick. Some lucky troop might have fortunate genes, conferring traits that fit the next challenge handed out by the ever-altering world. They would do well. But if those genes never passed to many pans, what did it matter?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With some small amount of outbreeding, that trait got spread into other bands. Down through the strainer of time, others picked up the trait. It spread.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This meant it was actually <span class="italic">helpful</span> to develop smoldering animosity to outsiders, an immediate sense of their wrongness. <span class="italic">Don’t breed with them.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So small bands held fast to their eccentric traits, and some prospered. Those lived on; most perished. Evolutionary jumps happened faster in small, semi-isolated bands which outbred slightly. They kept their genetic assets in one small basket, the troop. Only occasionally did they mate with another troop—often, through rape.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The price was steep: a strong preference for their own tiny lot.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They hated crowds, strangers, noise. Bands of less than ten were too vulnerable to disease or predators; a few losses and the group failed. Too many, and they lost the concentration of close breeding. They were intensely loyal to their group, easily identifying each other in the dark by smell, even at great distances. Because they had many common genes, altruistic actions were common.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They even honored heroism—for if the hero died, his shared genes were still passed on through his relatives.</span></p><a id="page414"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Even if strangers could pass the tests of difference in appearances, manner, smell, grooming, even then, culture could amplify the effects. Newcomers with different language or habits and posture would seem repulsive. Anything that served to distinguish a band would help keep hatreds high.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Each small genetic ensemble would then be driven by natural selection to stress the noninherited differences, even arbitrary ones, dimly connected to survival fitness…and so they could evolve culture. As humans had.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Diversity in their tribal intricacies avoided genetic watering down. They heeded the ancient call of aloof, wary tribalism.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari/Ipan shifted uneasily. Midway through his thinking, the word <span class="italic">they</span> had come in Hari’s thinking to mean humans as well as pans. The description fit both.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That was the key. Humans fit into the gigantic Empire <span class="italic">despite</span> their innate tribalism, their panlike heritage. It was a miracle!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But even miracles called out for explanation. Pans could be useful models for the gentry and the vast citizenry, the two classes encouraged to breed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yet how could the Empire possibly have kept itself stable, using such crude creatures as humans?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had never seen the issue before in such glaring, and humbling, light.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And he had no answer.</span></p>
