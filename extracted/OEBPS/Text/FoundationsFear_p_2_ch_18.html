      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Sybyl sat anxiously beside Monsieur Boker in the Great Coliseum. They were near the Imperial Gardens and an air of importance seemed to hover over everything.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She could not stop tapping her nails—her best full formal set—on her knees. Among the murmur of four hundred thousand other spectators in the vast bowl, she anxiously awaited the appearance of the Maid and Voltaire on a gigantic screen.</span></p><a id="page168"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Civilization, she thought, was a bit boring. Her time with the sims had opened her eyes to the <span class="italic">force,</span> the heady electricity, of the dark past. They had fought wars, slaughtered each other, all—supposedly—for ideas.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Now, swaddled in Empire, humanity was soft. Instead of bloody battles, satisfyingly final, there were “fierce” trade wars, athletic head-buttings. And lately, a fashion for debates.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This collision of sims, touted everywhere on Trantor, would be watched by over twenty billion households. And it was beamed to the entire Empire, wherever the creaky funnels of the wormhole network went. The rude vigor of the prehistoric sims was undeniable; she felt it herself, a quickening in her pulse.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The merest few interviews and glimpses of the sims had intrigued the 3D audience. Those who brought up the age-old laws and prohibitions got shouted down. The air crackled with the zest for the <span class="italic">new.</span> No one had anticipated that this debate would balloon into <span class="italic">this.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This could spread. Within weeks, Junin could inflame all Trantor into a renaissance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And she was going to take every scrap of credit for it that she could, of course.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She looked around at the president and other top-ranking executives of Artifice Associates, all chattering away happily.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The president, to demonstrate neutrality, sat between Sybyl and Marq—who had not spoken to each other since the last meeting.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>On Marq’s far side his client, the Skeptics’ representative, scanned the program; next to him, Nim. Monsieur Boker gave Sybyl a nudge. “That can’t be what I think it is,” he said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl followed his eyes to a distant row at the back where what looked like a mechman sat quietly beside<a id="page169"></a> a human girl. Only licensed mech vendors and bookies were allowed in the stadium.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Probably her servant,” Sybyl said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Minor infractions of the rules did not disturb her as they did Monsieur Boker, who’d been especially testy since a 3D caster leaked the news that Artifice Associates was representing both the Preservers and Skeptics. Fortunately, the leak occurred too late for either party to do anything about it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Mechserves aren’t <span class="italic">allowed,</span>” Monsieur Boker observed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Maybe she’s handicapped,” Sybyl said to placate him. “Needs help in getting around.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It won’t understand what’s going on anyway,” said Marq, directing his remark to Monsieur Boker. “They’re truncated. Just a bunch of decision-making modules, really.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Precisely why it has no business here,” replied Monsieur Boker.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq beeped the arm of his chair and ostentatiously placed a bet on Voltaire to win.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He’s never won a bet in his whole life,” Sybyl told Monsieur Boker. “No head for the math.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Is that so?” Marq shot back, leaning forward to address Sybyl directly for the first time. “Why don’t you put your money where your lovely mouth is?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ve got the probabilities on this one bracketed,” she said primly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You couldn’t solve the integral equation.” Marq snorted derisively.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her nostrils flared. “A thousand.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Mere tokenism,” Marq chided her, “considering what you’re being paid for this project.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The same as you,” said Sybyl.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Will you two cut it <span class="italic">out,</span>” Nim said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Tell you what,” said Marq. “I’ll bet my entire salary for the project on Voltaire. You bet yours on your anachronistic Maid.”</span></p><a id="page170"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hey,” Nim said. “Hey.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The president deftly addressed Marq’s client, the Skeptic. “It’s this keen competitive spirit that’s made Artifice Associates the planet’s leader in simulated intelligences.” Artfully he turned to the rival, Boker. “We try to—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re on!” cried Sybyl.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her dealings with the Maid had convinced her that the irrational must have a place in the human equation, too. She remained convinced for about three quick eye-blinks, and then began to doubt.</span></p>
