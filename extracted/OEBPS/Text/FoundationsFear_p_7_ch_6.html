      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“Vector aside for search,” came an automatic command from an Imperial vessel.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They had no choice. The big-bellied Imperial scooped them up within seconds after their emergence from a medium-sized wormhole mouth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Transgression tax,” a computerized system announced. “Planet Obejeeon demands that special carriers pay—” A blur of computer language followed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Let’s pay it,” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I wonder if it will provide a tracer for Lamurk?” Dors said over the internal comm.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What is our option?”</span></p><a id="page480"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“I shall use my own personal indices.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For a wormhole transit? That will bankrupt you!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is safer.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari fumed while they floated in magnetic grapplers beneath the Imperial picket ship. The wormhole orbited a heavily industrialized world. Gray cities sprawled over the continents and webbed across the seas in huge hexagonals.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Empire had two planetary modes: rural and urban. Helicon was a farm world, socially stable because of its time-honored lineages and stable economic modes. Such worlds, and the similar Femorustics, lasted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Obejeeon, on the other hand, seemed to cater to the other basic human impulse: clumping, seeking the rub of one’s fellows. Trantor was the pinnacle of city clustering.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had always thought it odd that humanity broke so easily into two modes. Now, though, his pan experience clarified these proclivities.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Pan love of the open and natural had its parallel in the rustic worlds. This included a host of possible societies, especially the Femo-pastoral attractor in psychohistory-space.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Its opposite pole—claustrophobic, though reassuring societies—emerged from the same psychodynamic roots as the pans’ tribal gathering. Pans’ obsessive grooming expressed itself in humans as gossip and partying. Pan hierarchies gave the basic shape to the various Feudalist attractor groups: Macho, Socialist, Paternal. Even the odd thantocracies, of some of the Fallen Worlds, fit the pattern. They had Pharaoh-figures promising admission to an afterlife and detailed rankings descending from his exalted peak in the rigid social pyramid.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>These categories he now felt in his gut. <span class="italic">That</span> was the element he had been missing. Now he could<a id="page481"></a> include nuances and shadings in the psychohistorical equations which reflected earned experience. That would be much better than the dry abstractions which had led him so far.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They’re paid off,” Dors sent over the comm. “Such corruption!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ummm, yes, shocking.” Was he getting cynical? He wanted to turn and speak with her, but their pencil ship allowed scant socializing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Let’s go.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Where to?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“To…” He realized that he had no idea.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We have probably eluded pursuit.” Dors’ voice came through stiff and tight. He had learned to recognize signs of her own tension.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’d like to see Helicon again.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They would expect that.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He felt a stab of disappointment. Until now he had not realized how close to his heart his early years still were. Had Trantor dulled him to his own emotions? “Where, then?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I took advantage of this pause to alert a friend, by wormlink,” she said. “We may be able to return to Trantor, though through a devious route.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Trantor! Lamurk—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“May not expect such audacity.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Which recommends the idea.”</span></p>
