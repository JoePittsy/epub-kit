      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>At dinner he felt elated, exhausted, and not in the mood for conversation. Being a pan seemed to suppress<a id="page382"></a> his speech centers. It took some effort to ask ExSpec Vaddo about immersion technology. Usually he accepted the routine techno-miracles, but understanding pans meant understanding how he experienced them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The immersion hardware puts you in the middle of a pan’s anterior cingulate gyrus,” Vaddo said over dessert. “Just ‘gyrus’ for short. That’s the brain’s main cortical region for mediating emotions and expressing them through action.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">The</span> brain?” Dors asked. “What about ours?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo shrugged. “Same general layout. Pans’ are smaller, without a big cerebrum.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari leaned forward, ignoring his steaming cup of kaff. “This ‘gyrus,’ it doesn’t give direct motor control?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, we tried that. It disorients the pan so much, when you leave, it can’t get itself back together.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So we have to be more subtle,” Dors said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We have to be. In pan males, the pilot light is always on in neurons that control action and aggression—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That’s why they’re more violence-prone?” she asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We think so. It parallels structures in our own brains.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Really? Men’s neurons?” Dors looked doubtful.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Human males have higher activity levels in their temporal limbic systems, deeper down in the brain—evolutionarily older structures.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So why not put me into that level?” Hari asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We place the immersion chips into the gyrus area because we can reach it from the top, surgically. The temporal limbic is way far down, impossible to implant a chip.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors frowned. “So pan males—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Are harder to control. Professor Seldon here is<a id="page383"></a> running his pan from the backseat, so to speak.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Whereas Dors is running hers from a control center that, for female pans, is more central?” Hari peered into the distance. “I was handicapped!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors grinned. “You have to play the hand you’re dealt.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s not fair.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Big Stick, biology is destiny.”</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The troop came upon rotting fruit. Fevered excitement ran through them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The smell was repugnant and enticing at the same time, and at first he did not understand why. The pans rushed to the overripe bulbs of blue and sickly green, popping open the skins, sucking out the juice.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Tentatively, Hari tried one. The hit was immediate. A warm feeling of well-being kindled up in him. Of course—the fruity esters had converted into alcohol! The pans were quite deliberately setting about getting drunk.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He “let” his pan follow suit. He hadn’t much choice in the matter.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan grunted and thrashed his arms whenever Hari tried to turn him away from the teardrop fruit. And after a while, Hari didn’t want to turn away, either. He gave himself up to a good, solid drunk. He had been worrying a lot lately, agitated in his pan, and…this was completely natural, wasn’t it?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then a pack of raboons appeared, and he lost control of Ipan.</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They come fast. Running two-legs, no sound. Their tails twitch, talking to each other.</span></p><a id="page384"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Five circle left. They cut off Esa.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest thunders at them. Hunker runs to nearest and it spikes him with its forepuncher.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I throw rocks. Hit one. It yelps and scurries back. But others take its place. I throw again and they come and the dust and yowling are thick and the others of them have Esa. They cut her with their punch-claws. Kick her with sharp hooves.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Three of them carry her off.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Our fems run, afraid. We warriors stay.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>We fight them. Shrieking, throwing, biting when they get close. But we cannot reach Esa.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then they go. Fast, running on their two hoofed legs. Furling their tails in victory. Taunting us.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>We feel bad. Esa was old and we loved her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Fems come back, nervous. We groom ourselves and know that the two-legs are eating Esa somewhere.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest come by, try to pat me. I snarl.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He Biggest! This thing he should have stopped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His eyes get big and he slap me. I slap back at him. He slam into me. We roll around in dust. Biting, yowling. Biggest strong, strong and pound my head on ground.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Other warriors, they watch us, not join in.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He beat me. I hurt. I go away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest starts calming down the warriors.<a id="page385"></a> Fems come by and pay their respects to Biggest. Touch him, groom him, feel him the way he likes. He mounts three of them real quick. He feeling Biggest all right.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Me, I lick myself. Sheelah come groom me. After a while I feel better. Forget about trouble.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I not forget Biggest beat me though. In front of everybody. Now I hurt, Biggest get grooming.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He let them come and take Esa. He Biggest, <span class="italic">he</span> should stop them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Some day I be all over him. On his back.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Some day <span class="italic">I</span> be Bigger.</span></p>
