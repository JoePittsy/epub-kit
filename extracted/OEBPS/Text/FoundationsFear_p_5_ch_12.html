      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“When did you bail out?” Dors asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“After Biggest stopped pounding on me…uh, on Ipan.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They were relaxing beside a swimming pool and the heady smells of the forest seemed to awaken in Hari the urge to be down there again, in the valleys of dust and blood. He trembled, took a deep breath. The fighting had been so involving he hadn’t wanted to leave, despite the pain. Immersion had a hypnotic quality.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I know how you feel,” she said. “It’s easy to totally identify with them. I left Sheelah when those raboons came close. Pretty scary.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Vaddo said they’re derived from Earth, too.<a id="page386"></a> Plenty of DNA overlap. But they show signs of extensive recent tinkering to make them predators.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Why would the ancients want <span class="italic">those</span>?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Trying to figure out our origins?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To his surprise, she laughed. “Not everyone has your same interests.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Why, then?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How about using raboons as game, to hunt? Something a little challenging?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Hunting?</span> The Empire has always been too far from throwback primitivism to—” He had been about to launch into a little lecture on how far humanity had come when he realized that he didn’t believe it anymore. “Um.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’ve always thought of people as cerebral. No psychohistory could work if it didn’t take into account our animal selves.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Our worst sins are all our own, I fear.” He had not expected that his experiences here would shake him so. This was sobering.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not at all. Genocide occurs in wolves and pans alike. Murder is widespread. Ducks and orangutans rape. Even ants have organized warfare and slave raids. Pans have at least as good a chance of being murdered as do humans, Vaddo says. Of all the hallowed human hallmarks—speech, art, technology, and the rest—the one which comes most obviously from animal ancestors is genocide.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’ve been learning from Vaddo.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It was a good way to keep an eye on him.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Better to be suspicious than sorry?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course,” she said blandly, giving nothing away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, luckily, even if we are superpans, Imperial order and communication blurs distinctions between Us and Them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That blunts the deep impulse to genocide.”</span></p><a id="page387"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>She laughed again, this time rather to his annoyance. “You haven’t understood history very well. Smaller groups still kill each other off with great relish. In Zone Sagittarius, during the reign of Omar the Impaler—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I concede, there are small-scale tragedies by the dozens. But on the scale where psychohistory might work, averaging over populations of many thousands of billions—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What makes you so sure numbers are any protection?” she asked pointedly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So far—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Empire has been in stasis.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“A steady-state solution, actually. Dynamic equilibrium.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And if that equilibrium fails?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well…then I have nothing to say.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She smiled. “How uncharacteristic.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Until I have a real, working theory.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“One that can allow for widespread genocide, if the Empire erodes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He saw her point then. “You’re saying I really need this ‘animal nature’ part of humans.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m afraid so. I’m trained to allow for it already.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He was puzzled. “How so?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t have your view of humanity. Scheming, plots, Sheelah grabbing more meat for her young, Ipan wanting to do in Biggest—those things happen in the Empire. Just better disguised.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Consider ExSpec Vaddo. He made a comment about your working on a ‘theory of history’ the other evening.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Who told him you were?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t think I—ah, you think he’s checking up on us?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He already knows.”</span></p><a id="page388"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“The security chief, maybe she told him, after checking on me with the Academic Potentate.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She graced him with an unreadable smile. “I do love your endless, naïve way of seeing the world.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Later, he couldn’t decide whether she had meant it as a compliment.</span></p>
