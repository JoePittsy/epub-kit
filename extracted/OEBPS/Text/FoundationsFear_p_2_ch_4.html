      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>She tried to ignore the sorceress called Sybyl, who claimed to be her creator—as if anyone but the King<a id="page115"></a> of Heaven could lay claim to such a feat. She didn’t feel like talking to anyone. Events crowded in—rushed, dense, suffocating. Her choking, pain-shot death still swarmed about her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>On the dunce’s cap—the one they’d set upon her shaven head on that fiery day, the darkest and yet most glorious day of her short life—her “crimes” were inscribed in the holy tongue: <span class="italic">Heretica, Relapsa, Apostata, Idolater.</span> Black words, soon to ignite.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The learned cardinals and bishops of the foul, English-loving University of Paris, and of the Church—Christ’s bride on earth!—had set her living body on fire. All for carrying out the Lord’s will—that the Great and True King should be His minister in France. For that, they had rejected the king’s ransom, and sent her to the searing pyre. What then might they not do to this sorceress called Sybyl—who, like her, dwelt among men, wore men’s attire, and claimed for herself powers that eclipsed those of the Creator Himself?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Please go away,” she murmured. “I must have silence if I am to hear my voices.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But neither La Sorcière nor the bearded man in black named Boker—who resembled uncannily the glowering patriarchs on the domed ceiling of the great church at Rouen—would leave her alone.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She implored them, “If you must talk, natter at Monsieur Arouet. That one likes nothing more.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sacred Maid, Rose of France,” said the bearded one, “was France your world?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My station in the world,” Joan said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Your planet, I mean.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Planets are in the sky. I was of the earth.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I mean—oh, never mind.” He spoke soundlessly to the woman, Sybyl—“Of the ground? Farmers? Could even prehistoricals be so ignorant?”—apparently thinking she could not read lips, a trick she had<a id="page116"></a> mastered to divine the deliberations of churchly tribunals.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan said, “I know what is sufficient to my charge.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Boker frowned, then rushed on. “Please, hear me out. Our cause is just. The fate of the sacred depends upon our winning to our side many converts. If we are to uphold the vessel of humanity, and time-honored traditions of our very identity, we must defeat Secular Skepticism.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She tried to turn away, but the clanking weight of her chains stopped her. “Leave me alone. Although I killed no one, I fought in many combats to assure the victory of France’s Great True King. I presided over his coronation at Rheims. I was wounded in battle for his sake.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She held up her wrists—for she was now in the foul cell at Rouen, in leg irons and chains. Sybyl had said this would anchor her, be good for her character in some way. As an angel, Sybyl was no doubt correct. Boker began to implore her, but Joan summoned strength to say, “The world knows how I was requited for my pains. I shall wage war no more.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker turned to the sorceress. “A sacrilege, to keep a great figure in chains. Can’t you transport her to some place of theological rest? A cathedral?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Context. Sims need context,” La Sorcière said without sound. Joan found she could read lips with a clarity she had never known. Perhaps this Purgatory improved its charges.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker clucked. “I am impressed with what you’ve done, but unless you can make her cooperate, what good is she to us?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You haven’t seen her at the summit of her Selfhood. The few historical associations we have been able to decipher claim that she was a ’mesmerizing presence,’ We’ll have to bring that out.”</span></p><a id="page117"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Can you not make her smaller? It’s impossible to talk to a giant.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid, to her astonishment, shrank by two-thirds in height.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker seemed pleased. “Great Joan, you misunderstand the nature of the war that lies ahead. Uncountable millennia have passed since your ascension into heaven. You—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid sat up. “Tell me one thing. Is the king of France a descendant of the English Henry’s House of Lancaster? Or is he a Valois, descended from the Great and True King Charles?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker blinked and thought. “I…I think it may be truly said that we Preservers of Our Father’s Faith, the party I represent, are in a manner of speaking descendants of your Charles.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid smiled. She <span class="italic">knew</span> her voices had been heaven-sent, no matter what the bishops said. She’d only denied them when they took her to the cemetery of St. Ouen, and then only for fear of the fire. She’d been right to recant her recantation two days later; the Lancastrian failure to annex France confirmed that. If Monsieur Boker spoke for descendants of the House of Valois, despite his clear absence of a noble title, she would hear him out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Proceed,” she said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker explained that this place was soon to hold a referendum. (After some deliberation with La Sorcière, he advised that Joan should think of this place as France, in essence.) The contest would be between two major parties, Preservers vs. Skeptics. Both parties had agreed to hold a Great Debate between two verbal duelists, to frame the salient question.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What issue?” the Maid asked sharply.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Whether mechanical beings endowed with artificial intelligence should be built. And if so, should<a id="page118"></a> they be allowed full citizenship, with all attendant rights.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid shrugged. “A joke? Only aristocrats and noblemen have rights.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not anymore, though of course we do have a class system. Now the common lot enjoy rights.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Peasants like me?” the Maid asked. “We?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker, face a moving flurry of exasperated scowls, turned to La Sorcière. “Must I do everything?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You wanted her as is,” La Sorcière said. “Or, rather, as was.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker spent two minutes ranting about something he called the Conceptual Shift. This term meant an apparently theological dispute about the nature of mechanical artifice. To Joan the answer seemed clear, but then, she was a woman of the fields, not a word artisan.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Why don’t you ask your king? One of his counselors? Or one of your learned men?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker curled his lip, dismissively fanned the air. “Our leaders are pallid! Weak! Rational doormats!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Surely—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You cannot imagine, coming from ancient passion. Intensity and passion are regarded as bad form, out of style. We wished to find intellects with the old <span class="italic">fire,</span> the—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No! Oh!” <span class="italic">The flames, licking</span>—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It was some moments before her breathing calmed and she could shakily listen again.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The great debate between Faith and Reason would be held in the Coliseum of Junin Sector before an audience of 400,000 souls. The Maid and her opponent would appear in holograms, magnified by a factor of thirty. Each citizen would then vote on the question.</span></p><a id="page119"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Vote?” the Maid inquired.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You wanted her uncorrupted,” La Sorcière said. “You got her.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid listened in silence, forced to absorb millennia in minutes. When Monsieur Boker finished, she said, “I excelled in battle, if only for a brief time, but never in argument. No doubt you know of my fate.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker looked pained. “The vagueries of the ancients! We have a skimpy historical frame around your, ah, representation—no more. We know not what place you lived, but we do know minutiae of events after your—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Death. You can speak of it. I am accustomed to it, as any Christian maiden should be, upon arrival in Purgatory. I know who you two are, as well.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>La Sorcière asked cautiously, “You…do?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Angels! You manifest yourselves as ordinary folk, to calm my fears. Then you set me a task. Even if it involves the roguish, it is a divine mission.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker nodded slowly, glancing at La Sorcière. “From the tatters of data flapping about your Self, we gather that your reputation was restored at hearings held twenty-six years after your death. Those involved in your condemnation repented of their mistake. You were called, in high esteem, <span class="italic">La Rose de la Loire.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She blinked back wistful tears. “Justice…Had I been skilled in argument, I’d have convinced my inquisitors—those English-loving preachers of the University of Paris!—that I am not a witch.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker seemed moved. “Even pre-antiquity knew when a holy power was with them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid laughed, lighthearted. “The Lord’s on the side of His Son, and the saints and martyrs, too. But that does not mean they escape failure and death.”</span></p><a id="page120"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“She’s right,” La Sorcière said. “Even worlds and galaxies share man’s fate.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We of spirituality need you,” Monsieur Boker pleaded. “We have become too much like our machines. We hold nothing sacred except the smooth functioning of our parts. We know you will address the question with intensity, yet in simplicity and truth. That is all we ask.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid felt fatigued. She needed solitude, time to reflect. “I must consult with my voices. Will there be only one, or many questions that I must address?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Just one.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The inquisitors had been far more demanding. They asked many questions, dozens, sometimes the same ones, over and over again. Right answers at Poitiers proved wrong elsewhere. Deprived of food, drink, rest, intimidated by the enforced journey to the cemetery, exhausted by the tedious sermon they compelled her to hear, and wracked by terror of the fire, she could not withstand their interrogation.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">“Does the Archangel Michael have long hair?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">“Is St. Margaret stout or lean?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">“Are St. Catherine’s eyes brown or blue?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They trapped her into assigning to voices of the spirit attributions of the flesh. Then they perversely condemned her for confounding sacred spirit with corrupt flesh.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>All had been miasma. And in Purgatory, worse trials could ensue. She could not therefore be certain if this Boker would turn out to be friend or foe.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What is it?” she wanted to know. “This single question you want me to answer.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There is universal consensus that man-made intelligences have a kind of brain. The question we want you to answer is whether they have a soul.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Only the Almighty has the power to create a soul.”</span></p><a id="page121"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker smiled. “We Preservers couldn’t agree with you more. Artificial intelligences, unlike us, their creators, have no soul. They’re just machines. Mechanical contrivances with electronically programmed brains. Only man has a soul.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“If you already know the answer to the question, why do you need me?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“To persuade! First the undecided of Junin Sector, then Trantor, then the Empire!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid reflected. Her inquisitors had known the answers to the questions they plied her with, too. Monsieur Boker seemed sincere, but then so were those who pronounced her a witch. Monsieur Boker had told her the answer beforehand, one with which any sensible person would agree. Still, she could not be sure of his intentions. Not even the crucifix she asked the priest to hold aloft was proof against the oily smoke, the biting flames….</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well?” asked Monsieur Boker. “Will the Sacred Rose consent to be our champion?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These people I must convince. Are they, too, descendants of Charles, the Great and True King, of the House of Valois?”</span></p>
