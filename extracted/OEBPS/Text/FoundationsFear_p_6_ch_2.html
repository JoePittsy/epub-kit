      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>They had escaped, somehow.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>One moment the alien fog had enveloped the mountain ranges. The next, Voltaire had extricated himself and Joan. But he kept saying, as they fled across a barren sea of stinking liquid corpses, that they had to…to <span class="italic">give birth.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We <span class="italic">make</span> ourselves into children?” she called to him, avoiding the sight of twisted, bloated bodies below. Somehow the alien fog manifested its loathsome self by reminding them of human mortality. Thus it dogged them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Bad metaphor. We must manufacture and hide some copies of ourselves.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He raised a hand and <span class="italic">shot</span> her a bolt of <span class="italic">knowing:</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Termed variously Dittos, Duplicates, or Copies, all such hold a tenuous existence. Society has decisively rejected what antiquity called the Copy Fallacy: the belief that a digital Self was identical to the Original, and that an Original should feel that a Ditto itself somehow carried them forward into immortality.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We must do so to be sure we survive, when the fog catches us? I will slay them, instead!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire laughed. “Your sword—they can control it, if they like. They captured your defense programming, and mine—though, as they implied, I rely mostly upon wit.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Dittos…? I fail to understand.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Refuting the Copy Fallacy is straightforward, an exercise in the calculus of logic. A simple exercise makes the point. Imagine yourself promised that you will be resurrected digitally, immediately after your death. Assign a price tag you will pay for that,<a id="page445"></a> insurance of a sort. Then imagine that, well, perhaps it would not be started right away, but sometime in future…<span class="italic">we promise.</span> As that date recedes, people’s enthusiasm for paying for Self Copies dims—demonstrating that it was the hope of <span class="italic">continuity</span> they unconsciously relished.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I see.” She vomited into her hand with what she hoped was a ladylike reserve. The stench of the bloated corpses was penetrating.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“In the end, Copies benefited themselves, not the dead. Thus on Trantor, and throughout the Empire, it is illegal.” Voltaire sighed. “Moralists! They never understand. To ban something makes it enticing. That is why such entities inhabit this Mesh.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They are all illegal?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“All but the fog. That is…worse.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But if a Ditto is the same as a person, why not—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah. The contradiction of Copying, known in antiquity as Levinson’s Paradox: To the degree that a Copy approaches perfection, it defeats itself.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But you just said—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“In being an absolutely perfect Copy—so that no one can tell it from the Original—it transforms the Original into a duplicate, yes? This means the perfect Copy is no longer a perfect Copy, <span class="italic">because it has obliterated, rather than preserved, the uniqueness of the Original</span>—and thus failed to copy a central aspect of the Original. A perfect, artificial human intelligence would inevitably have this effect on its natural precursor.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan held her head. “Such traps of logic! You are like the Augustines!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There is more. Here—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A huge Voltaire appeared on the horizon, striding toward them in velvet finery. They flew around this Voltaire Peak and it thundered at them, “I am a Copy, true, but I have thought on these fogs you encountered.”</span></p><a id="page446"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“You saw them?” Joan shouted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I was made some long intervals ago, but my Lord—” the apparition bowed to the tiny Original “—had datapunched me forward.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He is a quick study,” the Original said modestly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Ditto thundered, “Speaking broadly, I penned of such fogs in my magnum opus, <span class="italic">Micromegas.</span> I haven’t a copy, alas, or you could ingest it in a trice. I portrayed two giants, one from Saturn, the other from Sirius.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan called, “You think this fog comes—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It evaporated from the leading edge of this Empire—hence, a fog. As humanity spread, so did the fog rise above the plane of the Galaxy like a funeral dirge. It is ancient and strange and not of us. In <span class="italic">Micromegas,</span> I held that all Nature, all the planets, should obey eternal laws. Surely it would be very singular that there should be a little animal, five feet high, who, in contempt of these laws, could act as he pleased, solely according to his caprice.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We follow the Creator, not laws.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire Ditto waved away the objection, holding his nose against the reek from below. “The Lord’s laws, then, if you demand an author—though a great one stands before you already, my love.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I doubt your kind of love applies here.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Peak Voltaire smiled. “Falstaff cried in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor,</span> ‘Let the sky rain potatoes!’—because the new luxury vegetable of that time, imported from exotic America, for a while was believed to be an aphrodisiac, because of its testicular shape. Similarly, I greet the strange and alien as potential aids.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The fog wishes to murder us.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, one can’t have everything to one’s liking.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With a wave from the Original, rains fell from a porous leaden sky upon the Alps Voltaire. He<a id="page447"></a> eroded, smiling with resignation as he spread into rivulets.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Original flew to Joan and kissed her. “Worry not. Running a Ditto of your Self, giving it autonomy, means it can also change itself—become NotSelf. Your Ditto could shape its own motivations, goals, habits, edit away memories and tastes. For example, your Ditto could erase any liking for impressionist opera and overlay a passion for linear folk.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What are those?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Mere acoustic fashion. Your Ditto could enjoy rhythms that would have bored your true Self into a coma.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Have they…souls?” Even to her devout ears, the question sounded hollow here.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Remember, they are illegal, and share the anxious natures of their Originals. After all, only troubled people would consider making a backup of themselves.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Can they be saved for heaven, then?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Always back to that foundation, the holy.” Voltaire shrugged. “As I have seen them, Dittos fidget, their stress chemistry rises, their metabolics lurch, their heart-sims hammer, their lungs flutter in intense dread. Typical Dittos talk incessantly, acutely uncomfortable. Many demand that they be edited, truncated—and finally killed.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“A sin!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, a sim. We are solely responsible for it, so it cannot be damned.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But suicide!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Think of it as a shadow of yourself.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She staggered, thrown into moral confusion. The eating flame of uncertainty was worse than the pyre and smoke she had known as a girl. In her a tiny voice spoke coolly:</span></p><a id="page448"></a>

      <div class="extract3">
        <p class="extractTextNoIndent"><span>Is consciousness just a property of special algorithms, sliding sheets of information, digital packets jumping through conceptual hoops? My dear, do not suppose that a numerical model, simulating you watching a sunset, must feel the same way you, its lovely Original, did. It is surely profitless to doubt the inner lives of simulated consciousness, when nobody asks the same question of adding machines. Eh?</span></p>
      </div>

      <p class="para"><span>She felt this tiny voice as her Voltaire. It calmed her, though she could not say why.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A slight breeze said to her, <span class="italic">Inner logics now soothe, compensating piety</span>—but she paid its news no mind.</span></p>
