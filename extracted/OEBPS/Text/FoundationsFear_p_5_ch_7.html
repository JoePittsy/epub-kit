      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>He stayed with it this time. After the first crisis, when the Stranger pans came running through, he sat and let himself get groomed for a long time. It really did calm him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Him? Who was he?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This time he could fully sense the pan mind. Not below him—that was a metaphor—but <span class="italic">around</span> him. A swarming scattershot of senses, thoughts, fragments like leaves blowing by him in a wind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And the wind was <span class="italic">emotion.</span> Blustering gales, howling and whipping in gusts, raining thoughts like soft hammer blows.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>These pans thought poorly, in the sense that he could get only shards, like human musings chopped by a nervous editor. But pans felt intensely.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Of course,</span> he thought—and he could think, nestled in the hard kernel of himself, wrapped in the pan mind. <span class="italic">Emotions told it what to do, without thinking. Quick reactions demanded that. Strong feeling amplified subtle cues into strong imperatives.<a id="page366"></a> Blunt orders from Mother Evolution.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He saw now that the belief that high order mental experiences like emotion were unique to people was…simply conceited. These pans shared much of the human worldview. A theory of pan psychohistory could be valuable.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He gingerly separated himself from the dense, pressing pan mind. He wondered if the pan knew he was here. Yes, it did—dimly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yet this did not bother the pan. He integrated it into his blurred, blunt world. Hari was somewhat like an emotion, just one of many fluttering by and staying a while, then wafting away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Could he be more than that? He tried getting the pan to lift its right arm—and it was like lead. He struggled for a while that way with no success. Then he realized his error. He could not overpower this pan, not as a kernel in a much larger mind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He thought about this as the pan groomed a female, picking carefully through coarse hair. The strands smelled good, the air was sweet, the sun stroked him with blades of generous warmth…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Emotion. Pans didn’t follow instructions because that simply lay beyond them. They could not understand directions in the human sense. Emotions—those they knew. He had to be an emotion, not a little general giving orders.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He sat for a while simply being this pan. He learned—or rather, he felt. The troop groomed and scavenged food, males eyeing the perimeter, females keeping close to the young. A lazy calm descended over him, carrying him effortlessly through warm moments of the day.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Not since boyhood had he felt anything like this. A slow, graceful easing, as though there were no time at all, only slices of eternity.</span></p><a id="page367"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>In this mood, he could concentrate on a simple movement—raising an arm, scratching—and create the desire to do it. His pan responded. To make it happen, he had to <span class="italic">feel</span> his way toward a goal.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Catching a sweet scent on the wind, Hari thought about what food that might signal. His pan meandered upwind, sniffed, discarded the clue as uninteresting. Hari could now smell the reason why: fruit, true, sweet, yes—but inedible for a pan.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Good. He was learning. And he was integrating himself into the deep recesses of this pan-mind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Watching the troop, he decided to name the prominent pans, to keep them straight: Agile the quick one, Sheelah the sexy one, Grubber the hungry one…But what was his own name? His he dubbed Ipan. Not very original, but that was its main characteristic, <span class="italic">I as pan.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Grubber found some bulb-shaped fruit and the others drifted over to scavenge. The hard fruit smelled a little too young (how did he know that?), but some ate it anyway.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And which of these was Dors? They had asked to be immersed in the same troop, so one of these—he forced himself to count, though somehow the exercise was like moving heavy weights in his mind—these twenty-two was her. How could he tell? He ambled over to several females who were using sharp-edged stones to cut leaves from branches. They tied the strands together so they could carry food.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari peered into their faces. Mild interest, a few hands held out for stroking, an invitation to groom. No glint of recognition in their eyes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He watched a big fem, Sheelah, carefully wash sand-covered fruit in a creek. The troop followed suit; Sheelah was a leader of sorts, a female lieutenant to Biggest.</span></p><a id="page368"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>She ate with relish, looked around. There was grain growing nearby, past maturity, ripe tan kernels already scattered in the sandy soil. Concentrating, Hari could tell from the faint bouquet that this was a delicacy. A few pans squatted and picked grains from the sand, slow work. Sheelah did the same, and then stopped, gazing off at the creek. Time passed, insects buzzed. After a while she scooped up sand and kernels and walked to the brook’s edge. She tossed it all in. The sand sank, the kernels floated. She skimmed them off and gulped them down, grinning widely.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>An impressive trick. The other pans did not pick up on her kernel-skimming method. Fruit washing was conceptually easier, he supposed, since the pan could keep the fruit the whole time. Kernel-skimming demanded throwing away the food first, then rescuing it—a harder mental jump.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He thought about her and in response Ipan sauntered over her way. He peered into Sheelah’s eyes—and she winked at him. Dors! He wrapped hairy arms around her in a burst of love.</span></p>
