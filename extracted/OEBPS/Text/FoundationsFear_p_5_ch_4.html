      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>A good day. Plenty of fat grubs to eat in a big moist log. Dig them out with my nails, fresh tangy sharp crunchy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest, he shoves me aside. Scoops out plenty rich grubs. Grunts. Glowers.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>My belly rumbles. I back off and eye Biggest. He’s got pinched-up face so I know not to fool with him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I walk away, I squat down. Get some picking from a fem. She finds some-fleas, cracks them in her teeth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest rolls the log around some to knock a few grubs loose, finishes up. He’s strong. Fems watch him. Over by the trees a bunch of fems chatter, suck their teeth. Everybody’s sleepy now in early afternoon, lying in the shade. Biggest, though, he waves at me and Hunker and off we go.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Patrol. Strut tall, step out proud. I like it fine. Better than humping, even.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Down past the creek and along to where the hoof smells are. That’s the shallow spot. We cross and go into the trees sniff-sniffing and there are two Strangers.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They don’t see us yet. We move smooth, quiet. Biggest picks up a branch and we do, too. Hunker is sniffing<a id="page357"></a> to see who these Strangers are and he points off to the hill. Just like I thought, they’re Hillies. The worst. Smell bad.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hillies come onto our turf. Make trouble. We make it back.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>We spread out. Biggest, he grunts and they hear him. I’m already moving, branch held up. I can run pretty far without going all-fours. The Strangers cry out, big-eyed. We go fast and then we’re on them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They have no branches. We hit them and kick and they grab at us. They are tall and quick. Biggest slams one to the ground. I hit that one so Biggest knows real well I’m with him. Hammer hard, I do. Then I go quick to help Hunker.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His Stranger has taken his branch away. I club the Stranger. He sprawls. I whack him good and Hunker jumps on him and it is wonderful.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Stranger tries to get up and I kick him solid. Hunker grabs back his branch and hits again and again with me helping hard.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest, his Stranger gets up and starts to run. Biggest whacks his ass with the branch, roaring and laughing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Me, I got my skill. Special. I pick up rocks. I’m the best thrower, better than Biggest even.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Rocks are for Strangers. My buddies, them I’ll scrap with, but never use rocks. Strangers, though, they deserve to get rocks in the face. I love to<a id="page358"></a> bust a Stranger that way.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I throw one clean and smooth. Catch the Stranger on the leg. He stumbles. I smack him good with a sharp-edged rock in the back.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He runs fast then. I can see he’s bleeding. Big red drops in the dust.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest laughs and slaps me and I know I’m in good with him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hunker is clubbing his Stranger. Biggest takes my club and joins in. The blood all over the Stranger sings warm in my nose and I jump up and down on him. We keep at it like that a long time. Not worried about the other Stranger coming back. Strangers are brave sometimes, but they know when they have lost.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Stranger stops moving. I give him one more kick.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>No reaction. Dead maybe.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>We scream and dance and holler out our joy.</span></p>
