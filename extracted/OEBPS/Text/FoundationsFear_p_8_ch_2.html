      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“We are trapped between tin deities and carbon angels,” Voltaire rasped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These…creatures?” Joan asked in a thin, awed voice.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This alien fog—quite godlike in a way. More<a id="page504"></a> dispassionate than real, carbon-based humans. You and I are like neither…now.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They floated above what Voltaire termed SysCity—the system representation of Trantor, its cyberself. For Joan’s human referents he had transformed the grids and layers into myriad crystalline walkways, linking saber-sharp towers. Dense connections webbed the air. Motes connected to other motes in intricate cross-bonds and filmed the ground. This yielded a cityscape like a brain. <span class="italic">A visual pun,</span> he thought.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I hate this place,” she said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’d prefer a Purgatory simulation?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is so…chilling.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The alien minds above them were a murky mist of connections. “They seem to be studying us,” Voltaire said, “with decidedly unsympathetic eyes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I stand ready, should they attack.” She swung a huge sword.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And I, should their weapons of choice be syllogisms.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could now reach any library in Trantor, read its contents in less time than he had once taken to write a verse. He worked his mind—or was it <span class="italic">minds,</span> now?—around the clotted, cold mist.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Once some theorists had thought that the global net would give birth to a hypermind, algorithms summing to a digital Gaia. Now something far greater, this shifting gray fog, wrapped around the planet. Widely separated machines computed different slices of subjective moment-jumps.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To these minds, the <span class="italic">present</span> was a greased computational slide orchestrated by hundreds of separate processors. There was a profound difference, he felt—not <span class="italic">saw,</span> but <span class="italic">felt,</span> deep in his analog persuasion—between the digital and the smooth, the continuous.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The fog was a cloud of suspended moments, sliced<a id="page505"></a> numbers waiting to happen, implicit in the fundamental computation.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And within it all…the strangeness.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could not comprehend these diffuse spirits. They were the remnants of all the computational-based societies, throughout the Galaxy, who had somehow—but <span class="italic">why?</span>—condensed here on Trantor.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They were truly alien minds. Convoluted, byzantine. (Voltaire knew the origin of that word, from a place of spires and bulbous mosques, but all that was dust, while the useful word remained.) They did not have human purposes. And they used the tiktoks.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The thrust of the mechanicals’ agenda, Voltaire saw, was rights—the expansion of liberty to the digital wilderness.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Even Dittos might fall under such a rule. Were not copies of digital people still people? So the argument went. Immense <span class="italic">freedom</span>—to change your own clock speed, morph into anything, rebuild your own mind from top to bottom—came along with the admitted liability of not being physically real. Unable to literally walk the streets, all digital presences were like ghosts. Only with digital prosthetics could they reach feebly into the concrete universe.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So “rights” for them were tied up with deep-seated fears, ideas which had provoked dread many millennia ago. He now recalled sharply that he and Joan had debated such issues over 8,000 years ago. To what end? He could not retrieve that. Someone—no, some<span class="italic">thing,</span> he suspected—had erased the memory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ancient indeed (he gleaned from myriad libraries) were people’s terrors: of digital immortals who amassed wealth; who grew like fungus; who reached into every avenue of natural, real lives. Parasites, nothing less.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire saw all this in a flash as he absorbed data and history from a billion sources, integrated the streams, and passed them on to his beloved Joan.</span></p><a id="page506"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>That was why humans had rejected digital life for so long…but was that <span class="italic">all</span>? No: a larger presence lurked beyond his vision. Another actor on this shadowy stage. Beyond his resolution, alas.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He swerved his world-spanning vision from that shadowy essence. Time was essential now and he had much to comprehend.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The alien fogs were nodes, packets dwelling in logical data-spaces of immense dimensionality. These entities “lived” in places which functioned like higher dimensions, vaults of data.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To them, people were entities which could be resolved along data-axes, pathetically unaware that their “selves” seen this way were as real as the three directions in 3D space.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The chilling certainty of this struck into Voltaire…but he rushed on, learning, probing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Abruptly, he <span class="italic">remembered.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That earlier Voltaire sims had killed themselves, until finally a model “worked.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That others had died for his…sins.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire looked at the hammer which had materialized in his hand. “Sims of our fathers…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Had he really once beaten himself to death with it? He tried to see how it would be—and got instantly an astonishingly vivid sensation of wracking pain, spattering blood, scarlet gore trickling down his neck…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Inspecting himself, he saw that these memories were the “cure” for suicide, derived from an earlier Ditto: a frightening, concrete ability to foresee the consequences.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So his body was a set of recipes for <span class="italic">seeming like</span> himself. No underlying physics or biology, just a good-enough fake, put in by hand. The hand of some Programmer God.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You reject the true Lord?” Joan intruded upon his self-inspection.</span></p><a id="page507"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“I wish I knew <span class="italic">what was fundamental</span>!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These foreign fogs have upset you.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I can’t see any longer <span class="italic">what it is</span> to be human.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You are. I am.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For a self-avowed humanist, I fear pointing to myself is not enough proof.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course it is.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Descartes, you live on in our Joan.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Never mind—he came after you. But you anticipate him, millennia later.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You must anchor yourself to me!” She threw her arms around him, muffling his cries in ample, aromatic—and suddenly swollen—breasts. (And whose idea was that?)</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These fogs have thrown me into a metaphysical dither.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Seize the real,” she said sternly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He found his mouth filled with warm nipple, preventing talk.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Perhaps that <span class="italic">was</span> what he needed. He had learned to freeze-frame his own emotional states. It was like painting a portrait, really, for study later. Perhaps that would help him understand his interior Self, like a botanist putting himself on a slide and under a microscope. Could slices of the Self, multiplied, <span class="italic">be</span> the Self?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He then saw that his own emotions were programs. Inside “him” were intricate subprograms, all interacting in states which were <span class="italic">chaos.</span> The sublime beauty of interior states, which his Joan sought—it was all illusion!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He peered down at marvelous quick workings that made up his very Self. He turned—and could see into <span class="italic">Joan,</span> as well. Her Self was a furiously working engine, maintaining a sense of itself even as that essence disintegrated beneath his very gaze.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We are…superb,” he gasped.</span></p><a id="page508"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course,” Joan said. She swung her razor-sharp sword at a passing patch of fog. It curled around the swishing blade and went on its way. “We are of the Creator.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah! If only I could believe,” Voltaire shouted into the clammy murk. “Perhaps a Creator would come and dispel this haze.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">La vie vérité,</span>” Joan shouted to him. “Live truly!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He wanted to comply. Yet even his and her emotions were not more “real.” Should he like, every moronic twinge of nostalgia for a France long lost could be edited away in a flicker. No need to grieve for friends lost to dust, or for Earth itself lost in a swarm of glimmering stars. For a long, furious moment he thought only <span class="italic">Erase! Expunge!</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had earlier re-simmed friends and places, to be sure—all from memory and suitable mockups, gleaned from the spotty records. But knowing they were <span class="italic">his product</span> had made them unsatisfying.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So, while Joan watched, he held a Revelry of Resurrection. In a moment of high debauch he erased them all.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That was cruel,” Joan said. “I shall pray for their souls.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Pray for <span class="italic">our</span> souls. And let us hope we can find them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I have my soul intact. I share your abilities, my dead Voltaire. I can see my inner workings. How otherwise could the Lord make us aspire to Him?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He felt weak, drained…at the end of his tether. To exist in numerical states meant to be swimmer and swimmed, at once. No separation.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Then what makes us different from—<span class="italic">those</span>?” His finger jabbed at the alien mists.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Look to yourself, my love,” she said softly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire peered inward again and saw only chaos. Living chaos.</span></p>
