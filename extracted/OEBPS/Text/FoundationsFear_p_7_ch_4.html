      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>In the men’s room, above the urinal he used, Hari saw a small gold plaque: <span class="italic">Senior Pilot Joquan Beunn relieved himself here Octdent 4, 13,435.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Every urinal had a similar plaque. There was a washing machine in the locker room with a large plaque over it, reading <span class="italic">The entire 43rd Pilot Corps relieved themselves here Marlass 18, 13,675.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Pilot humor. It turned out to be absolutely predictive. He messed himself on his first training run.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As if to make the absolutely fatal length of a closing wormhole less daunting, the worm flyers had escape plans. These could only work in the fringing fields of the worm, where gravity was beginning to warp, and space-time was only mildly curved. Under the seat was a small, powerful rocket that propelled the entire cockpit out, automatically heading away from the worm.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>There is a limit to how much self-actuated tech one can pack into a small cockpit, though. Worse, worm mouths were alive with electrodynamic “weather”—writhing forks of lightning, blue discharges, red magnetic whorls like tornadoes. Electrical gear didn’t work well if a bad storm was brewing at the mouth. Most of the emergency controls were manual. Hopelessly archaic, but unavoidable.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So he and Dors went through a training program. Quite soon it was clear that if he used the Eject<a id="page472"></a> command he had better be sure that he had his head tilted back. That is, unless he wanted his kneecaps to slam up into his chin, which would be unfortunate, because he would be trying to check if his canopy had gone into a spin. This would be bad news, because his trajectory might get warped back into the worm. To correct any spin he had to yank on a red lever, and if that failed he had to then very quickly—in pilot’s terms, this meant about half a second—punch two blue knobs. When the spindown came, he then had to be sure to release the automatic actuator by pulling down on two yellow tabs, being certain that he sit up straight with hands between knees to avoid…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>…and so on for three hours. Everyone seemed to assume that since he was this famous mathematician he could of course keep an entire menu of instructions straight, timed to fractions of seconds.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>After the first ten minutes he saw no point in destroying their illusions, and simply nodded and squinted to show that he was carefully keeping track and absolutely enthralled. Meanwhile he solved differential equations in his head for practice.</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m sure you will be all right,” Buta Fyrnix said fulsomely to them in the departure lounge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had to admit this woman had proven better than he had hoped. She had cleared the way and stalled the Imperial offices’ Grey Men. Probably she shrewdly expected a payoff from him as First Minister. Very well; one’s life was worth a kickback.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I hope I can handle a wormship,” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And I,” Dors added.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Our training is the very best,” Fyrnix said. “The New Renaissance encourages individual excellence—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, I’m quite impressed,” Dors said. “Perhaps<a id="page473"></a> you can explain to me the details of your Creativity Creation program? I’ve heard so much about it….”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari gave her a slight smile of thanks for distracting Fyrnix. He instinctively disliked the brand of rampant self-assurance common on Sark. It was headed for a crackup, of that he was sure. He ached to get back to his full psychohistorical resources, to simulate this Sark case. His earlier work needed refinement. He had secretly gathered fresh data here and yearned to apply it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I do hope you’re not worried about the wild worm. Academician?” Fyrnix spoke to him again, brow furrowed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s a tight fit,” he said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They had to fly in a slender cylinder, Dors copiloting. Splitting the job had proved the only way to get them up to a barely competent level.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I think it’s <span class="italic">marvelous,</span> how courageous you two are.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We have little choice,” Dors said. This was artful understatement. Another day and the sector general’s officers would have Hari and Dors under arrest.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Riding in a little pencil ship. <span class="italic">Such</span> primitive means!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Uh, time to go,” Hari said behind a fixed smile. She was wearing thin again.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">I</span> agree with the Emperor. Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So the Emperor’s ghost-written remark had already spread here. Minor sayings moved fast, with Imperial muscle behind it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Still, Hari felt his stomach flutter with dread. “You’ve got a point.”</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had brushed off the remark.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Four hours later, closing at high velocity with the big wormhole complex, he saw her side of it.</span></p><a id="page474"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>He spoke on suitcomm to Dors. “In one of my classes—Nonlinear Philosophy, I believe—the professor said something I’ll never forget. ‘Ideas about existence pale beside the fact of existence.’ Quite true.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Bearing oh-six-nine-five,” she said rigorously. “No small talk.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nothing’s small out here—except that wild worm mouth.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The wild worm was a fizzing point of vibrant agitation. It orbited the main worm mouth, a distant bright speck.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Imperial ships patrolled the main mouth, ignoring this wild worm. They had been paid off long ago and expected a steady train of slimships to slip through the Imperial guard.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had passed through worm gates before, always in big cruisers plying routes through wormholes tens of meters across. Every hole of that size was the hub of a complex which buzzed with carefully orchestrated traffic. He could see the staging yards and injection corridors of the main route gleaming far away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Their wild worm, a renegade spin-off, could vanish at any moment. Its quantum froth advertised its mortality. <span class="italic">And maybe ours</span>…Hari thought.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Vector null sum coming up,” he called.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Convergent asymptotes, check,” Dors answered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Just like the drills they had gone through.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But coming at them was a sphere fizzing orange and purple at its rim. A neon-lit mouth. Tight, dark at the very center—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari felt a sudden desire to swerve, not dive into that impossibly narrow gullet.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors called out numbers. Computers angled them in. He adjusted with a nudge here and a twist there.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It did not help that he knew some of the underlying<a id="page475"></a> physics. Wormholes were held open with layers of negative energy, skins of antipressure made in the first convulsion of the universe. The negative energy in the “struts” was equivalent to the mass needed to make a black hole of the same radius.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So they were plunging toward a region of space of unimaginable density. But the danger lurked only at the rim, where stresses could tear them into atoms.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A bull’s-eye hit was perfectly safe. But an error—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Thrusters pulsed. The wild worm was now a black sphere rimmed in quantum fire.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Growing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari felt suddenly the helpless constriction of the pencil ship. Barely two meters across, its insulation was thin, safety buffers minimal. Behind him, Dors kept murmuring data and he checked…but part of him was screaming at the crushing sense of confinement, of helplessness.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He felt again the gut fear that had struck him in the streets of Sarkonia. Not claustrophobia, but something darker: a swampy fear of confusion, a riot of doubt. It seized him, squeezed his throat.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Vectors summing to within zero-seven-three,” Dors called.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her voice was calm, steady, a marvelous balm. He clung to its serene certainties and fought down his own panic.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Squeals of last-second corrections echoed in his cramped chamber. A quick kick of acceleration—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lightning curling snakelike blue and gold at them—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>—tumbling. Out the other end, in a worm complex fifteen thousand light years away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That old professor…damn right, he was,” he said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors sighed, her only sign of stress. “Ideas about<a id="page476"></a> existence pale…beside the fact of existence. Yes, my love. Living is bigger than any talk about it.”</span></p>
