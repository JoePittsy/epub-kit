      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“What?!” Voltaire exclaimed as he snapped into the context-frame.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Welcome,” Joan said, voice thin.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She had never initiated contact with him before. And he had yet to find the <span class="italic">Magots</span> actors. “I may have to reconsider my position on miracles,” he said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She lowered her eyes. For just an instant he suspected this was just so she could raise them: to look up at him without lifting her lovely head. Did she know how this captivated him? Her bosom rose and fell in a way his sensors found maddening since he could do nothing about it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire reached out for madam’s hand and raised it to his lips. He felt, however, nothing—and peevishly let it drop. “This is unbearable,” he said. “To long for union and feel nothing when it is achieved.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You feel <span class="italic">nothing</span> when we meet?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Ma chère Maquine,</span> sensors do not a sensuous being make. Don’t confuse sensoring with sensuality.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And how is it…Before…” Joan spoke with apparent difficulty, as if afraid she might be wounded by the answer.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I cannot manage the, uh, ‘programming’ here. We had the use of myriad capabilities, when we were trapped zoo animals of Artifice Associates. Here in the digital wild, my talents—though growing!—do not match that level. Yet.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I thought perhaps it was a holy deprivation. A help, truly, to rightful behavior.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Much more in history may be explained by incompetence than by ill will.”</span></p><a id="page305"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan looked away. “Sir, I summoned you because…since we last met, despite the warnings of my voices…I answered a call.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I told you not to do that!” Voltaire shouted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I had no choice,” she said. “I had to answer. It was…urgent.” Fear crept into her voice. “I cannot quite explain, but I know that the moment I did so, I hovered on the verge of absolute extinction.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire hid his concern behind a mask of levity. “No way for a saint to talk. You’re not supposed to admit the possibility of absolute extinction. Your canonization could be reversed.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan’s voice wavered, a candle flame stirred by dark winds of doubt. “I know only that I hovered on the brink of a great void, a chasm of darkness. I glimpsed, not eternity, but nothingness. Even my voices fell silent, humbled by the spectacle of…of…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of what?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nonbeing,” Joan said. “Disappearing, never to reappear again. I was about to be…erased.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Deletion.</span> The ferrets and their hounds.” Prickly gooseflesh fear invaded him. “How did you escape?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I didn’t,” the Maid said, awe undercutting fear. “That was eerier still. Whoever—whatever—it was let me go without injury. I stood before It, vulnerable, exposed. And It…released me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He felt a cold dread. He, too, had sensed unseeable entities just over his shoulder, watching, judging. There was something blankly alien about these visitations. He pulled himself back from the chilly memories. “From now on answer no calls <span class="italic">whatever.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid’s face clouded with doubt. “I had no choice.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ll find a better hiding place for you,” Voltaire assured her. “Make you invulnerable to involuntary appearances. Give you power—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You do not understand. This…Thing…could<a id="page306"></a> have snuffed me out like two fingers pinching a tiny flame. It will return, I know it. Meanwhile, I have but one wish.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Anything,” Voltaire said. “Anything in my power…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Restore us and our friends to the café.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Aux Deux Magots?</span> I am searching, but I don’t even know if it still exists!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Re-create it with the sorcery you have learned. If I am to tumble headlong into the void, let it not be before I spend one evening reunited with you and our dear friends. Breaking bread, sipping wine in the company of those I love…I ask nothing more before I am—erased.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re <span class="italic">not</span> going to be erased,” Voltaire assured her with far more conviction than he felt. “I’m going to transport you to a place no one will ever think to look. You’ll be unable to respond to any calls—not even if you think they are from me. But you will transmit to me often, do you understand?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I shall send my spiritual fraction, as well.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I believe they are giving me an itch already.” He did indeed feel a restless, edgy scratching at the edge of perception, like insects crawling in his brain. He shook himself. Why did a perfidious mathists’ logic rob him of his sensuality, and torture him with rasping irritations?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But her defiance had only begun. “You have taken my virginity, sir, yet you speak only slightingly of marriage. And of love.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Bien sur,</span> love between married couples may be possible—though I myself have never seen an instance of it—yet it is unnatural. Like being born with two fused toes. It happens, but only by mistake. One can, <span class="italic">naturellement,</span> live happily with any woman, provided one doesn’t love her.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She gave him an imperious glance. “I have become immune to your rogue ways.”</span></p><a id="page307"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>He shook his head sadly. “A dog is better off in this respect than I am in my present state.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He trailed his sim-finger lightly across her throat. Her head lolled back, her eyes closed, her lips parted. But he, alas, felt nothing. “Find a way,” he whispered. “Find a way.”</span></p>
