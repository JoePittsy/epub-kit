      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>He savored his work all the more, since he had less time for it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari sat in his darkened office, absolutely still, watching the 3D numerics evolve like luminous fogs in the air before him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Empire scholars had known the root basics of psychohistory for millennia. In ancient times, pedants had charted the twenty-six stable and meta-stable social systems. There were plenty of devolved planets to study, fallen into barbarism—like the Porcos and their Raging Rituals, the Lizzies and their Gyno-Governs.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He watched the familiar patterns form, as his<a id="page230"></a> simulation stepped through centuries of Galactic evolution. Some social systems proved stable only on small scales.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In the air hung the ranks of whole worlds, caught in stable Zones: Primitive Socialism; Femo-Pastoralism; Macho Tribalism. These were the “strong attractors” of human sociology, islands in the chaos sea.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Some societies labored through their meta-stability, then crashed: Theocracy, Transcendentalism, Macho Feudalism. This latter appeared whenever people had metallurgy and agriculture. Planets which had slid a long way down the curve would manifest it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Imperial scholars had long justified the Empire, threaded by narrow wormholes and lumbering hyperships, as the best human social structure. It had indeed proved stable and benevolent.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Their reigning model, Benign Imperial Feudalism, accepted that humans were hierarchical. As well, they were dynastically ambitious, liking the continuity of power and its pomp. They were quite devoted to symbols of unity, of Imperial grandeur. Gossip about the great was, for most people, the essence of history itself.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Imperial power was moderated by traditions of noble leadership, the assumed superiority of those who rose to greatness. Beneath such impressive resplendence, as Cleon well knew, lay the bedrock of an extremely honest, meritocratic civil service. Without that, corruption would spread like a stain across the stars, corroding the splendor.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He watched the diagram—a complex 3D web of surfaces, the landscape of social-space.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Slow-stepped, he could see individual event-waves washing through the sim. Each cell in the grid got recomputed every clock cycle, readjusting every nearest-neighbor interaction in 3D.</span></p><a id="page231"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>The working rules of thumb were not the true laws of physics, built up from fundamentals like maxion mechanics, or even from the simple NewTown Laws. Rather, they were rough algorithms that reduced intricate laws to trivial arithmetic. Society seen raw this way was crude, not mysterious at all.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then came chaos.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He was viewing the “policy-space,” with its family of variables: degree of polarity, or power concentration; size of coalitions; conflict scale. In this simple model, learning loops emerged. Starting from a plateau period of seeming stability but not stasis, the system produced a Challenger Idea.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This threatened stability, which forced formation of coalitions to oppose the challenge. Factions formed. Then they gelled. The coalitions could be primarily religious, political, economic, technological, even military—though this last was a particularly ineffective method, the data showed. The system then veered into a chaotic realm, sometimes emerging to new stability, sometimes decaying.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In the dynamic system there was a <span class="italic">pressure</span> created by the contrast between people’s ideal picture of the world and the reality. Too big a difference drove fresh forces for change. Often the forces were apparently unconscious; people knew something was wrong, felt restive, but could not fix on a clear cause.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">So much for “rational actor” models,</span> Hari thought. Yet some still clung to that obviously dumb approximation.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Everyone <span class="italic">thought</span> the Empire was simple.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Not the bulk of the population, of course, dazzled by the mix of cultures and exotica afforded by trade and communications from myriad worlds. They were perpetually distracted—an important damper on chaos.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Even to social theorists, though, the basic structure<a id="page232"></a> and interrelations seemed to be predictable, with a moderate number of feedback loops, solid and traditional. Conventional wisdom held that these could be easily separated out and treated.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Most important, there was central decision-making, or so most thought. The Emperor Knew Best, right?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In reality, the Empire was a nested, ordered hierarchy: Imperial Feudalism. At the lower bound were the Zones of the galaxy, sometimes only a dozen light-years across, up to a few thousand light years diameter. Above that were Compacts of a few hundred nearby Zones. The Compacts interlocked into the Galactic cross-linked system.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But the whole thing was sliding downhill. In the complex diagram, sparkling flickers came and went. <span class="italic">What were those?</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari close-upped the flares. Zones of chaos, where predictability becomes impossible. These fiery eruptions might be the clue to why the Empire was failing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari felt in his soul that unpredictability was bad—for humanity, for his mathematics. But it was inescapable.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This was the secret the Emperor and others must never know. That until he could rule chaos—or at least peer into it—psychohistory was a fraud.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He decided to look at a single case. Maybe that would be cleaner.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He selected Sark, the world which had found and developed the Voltaire and Joan sims. It billed itself as the Home of the New Renaissance—a common rhetorical posture, often adopted. They seemed bright and creative as he reviewed the status-grids.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari yawned despite himself. Sure, Sark looked good for now. A booming economy. A leader in styles and fashion.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But its profile classed it among the Chaos Worlds.<a id="page233"></a> They rose for a while, seeming to defy the damping mechanisms that held planets in the Imperial Equilibrium.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then their social fabric dissolved. They plummeted back into one of the Stasis States: Anarcho-Industrial for Sark, he would predict, from the data. No great fleets made this happen. The Empire did not, despite impressions, rule by force. Social evolutions made the Chaos Worlds falter and die. Usually, the Galaxy as a whole suffered few repercussions.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But lately, there had been more of them. And the Empire was visibly decaying. Productivity was down, incoherence in the social-spaces on the rise.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Why?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He got up and went for a workout at the gymnasium. Enough of the mind! Let his body sweat out the frustrations wrought by his intellect.</span></p>
