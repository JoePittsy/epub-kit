      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>They spent one last day immersed in their pans, sunning themselves beside a gushing stream. They had told Vaddo to bring the shuttle down the next day, book a wormhole transit. Then they entered the immersion capsule and sank into a last reverie.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Until Biggest started to mount Sheelah.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari/Ipan sat up, his head foggy. Sheelah was shrieking at Biggest. She slapped him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest had mounted Sheelah before. Dors had<a id="page392"></a> bailed out quickly, her mind returning to her body in the capsule.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Something was different now. Ipan hurried over and signed to Sheelah, who was throwing pebbles at Biggest. <span class="italic">What?</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She moved her hands rapidly, signing, <span class="italic">No go.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She could not bail out. Something was wrong back at the capsule. He could go back himself, tell them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari made the little mental flip that would bail him out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nothing happened.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He tried again. Sheelah threw dust and pebbles, backing away from Biggest. Nothing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>No time to think. He stepped between Sheelah and Biggest.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The massive pan frowned. Here was Ipan, buddy Ipan, getting in the way. Denying him a fem. Biggest seemed to have forgotten the challenge and beating of the day before.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>First he tried bellowing, eyes big and white. Then Biggest shook his arms, fists balled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari made his pan stand still. It took every calming impulse he could muster.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest swung his fist like a club.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan ducked. Biggest missed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was having trouble controlling Ipan, who wanted to flee. Sheets of fear shot up through the pan mind, hot yellows in the blue-black depths.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest charged forward, slamming Ipan back. Hari felt the jolt, a stabbing pain in his chest. He toppled backward, hit hard.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest yowled his triumph. Waved his arms at the sky.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest would get on top, he saw. Beat him again.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Suddenly he felt a deep, raw hatred.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>From that red seethe he felt his grip on Ipan tighten. He was riding both with and within the pan,<a id="page393"></a> feeling its raw red fear, overrunning that with an iron rage. Ipan’s own wrath fed back into Hari. The two formed a concert, anger building as if reflected from hard walls.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He might not be the same kind of primate, but he knew Ipan. Neither of them was going to get beaten again. And Biggest was not going to get Sheelah/Dors.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He rolled to the side. Biggest hit the ground where he had been.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan leaped up and kicked Biggest. Hard, in the ribs. Once, twice. Then in the head.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Whoops, cries, dust, pebbles—Sheelah was still bombarding them both. Ipan shivered with boiling energy and backed away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest shook his dusty head. Then he curled and rolled easily up to his feet, full of muscular grace, face a constricted mask. The pan’s eyes widened, showing white and red.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan yearned to run. Only Hari’s rage held him in place.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But it was a static balance of forces. Ipan blinked as Biggest shuffled warily forward, the big pan’s caution a tribute to the damage Ipan had inflicted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">I need some advantage,</span> Hari thought, looking around.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could call for allies. Hunker paced nervously nearby.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Something told Hari that would be a losing strategy. Hunker was still a lieutenant to Biggest. Sheelah was too small to make a decisive difference. He looked at the other pans, all chattering anxiously—and decided. He picked up a rock.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest grunted in surprise. Pans didn’t use rocks against each other. Rocks were only for repelling invaders. He was violating a social code.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest yelled, waved to the others, pounded the ground, huffed angrily. Then he charged.</span></p><a id="page394"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari threw the rock hard. It hit Biggest in the chest, knocked him down.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest came up fast, madder than before. Ipan scurried back, wanting desperately to run. Hari felt control slipping from him—and saw another rock. Suitable size, two paces back. He let Ipan turn to flee, then stopped him at the stone. Ipan didn’t want to hold it. Panic ran through him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari poured his rage into the pan, forced the long arms down. Hands grabbed at the stone, fumbled, got it. Sheer anger made Ipan turn to face Biggest, who was thundering after him. To Hari, Ipan’s arm came up in achingly slow motion. He leaned heavily into the pitch. The rock smacked Biggest in the face.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest staggered. Blood ran into his eyes. Ipan caught the iron scent of it, riding on a prickly stench of outrage.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari made the trembling Ipan stoop down. There were some shaped stones nearby, made by the fems to trim leaves from branches. He picked up one with a chipped edge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest shook his head, dizzy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan glanced at the sober, still faces of his troop. No one had ever used a rock against a troop member, much less Biggest. Rocks were for Strangers.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A long silence stretched. The pans stood rooted; Biggest grunted and peered in disbelief at the blood that spattered into his upturned hand.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan stepped forward and raised the jagged stone, edge held outward. Crude, but a cutting edge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest flared his nostrils and came at Ipan. Ipan swept the rock through the air, barely missing Biggest’s jaw.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest’s eyes widened. He huffed and puffed, threw dust, howled. Ipan simply stood with the rock and held his ground. Biggest kept up his anger-display for a long while, but he did not attack.</span></p><a id="page395"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>The troop watched with intense interest. Sheelah came and stood beside Ipan. It would have been against protocols for a female to take part in male dominance rituals.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her movement signaled that the confrontation was over. But Hunker was having none of that. He abruptly howled, pounded the ground, and scooted over to Ipan’s side.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was surprised. With Hunker maybe he could hold the line against Biggest. He was not fool enough to think that this one stand-off would put Biggest to rest. There would be other challenges and he would have to fight them. Hunker would be a useful ally.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He realized that he was thinking in the slow, muted logic of Ipan himself. He <span class="italic">assumed</span> that the pursuit of pan status-markers was a given, the great goal of his life.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This revelation startled him. He had known that he was diffusing into Ipan’s mind, taking control of some functions from the bottom up, seeping through the deeply buried, walnut-sized gyrus. It had not occurred to him that the pan would diffuse into <span class="italic">him.</span> Were they now married to each other in an interlocked web that dispersed mind and self?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hunker stood beside him, eyes glaring at the other pans, chest heaving. Ipan felt the same way, madly pinned to the moment. Hari realized that he would have to do something, break this cycle of dominance and submission which ruled Ipan at the deep, neurological level.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He turned to Sheelah. <span class="italic">Get out?</span> he signed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">No. No.</span> Her pan face wrinkled with anxiety.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Leave.</span> He waved toward the trees, pointed to her, then him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She spread her hands in a gesture of helplessness.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It was infuriating. He had so much to say to her and he had to funnel it through a few hundred signs. He<a id="page396"></a> chippered in a high-pitched voice, trying vainly to force the pan lips and palate to do the work of shaping words.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It was no use. He had tried before, idly, but now he wanted to badly and none of the equipment worked. It couldn’t. Evolution had shaped brain and vocal chords in parallel. Pans groomed, people talked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He turned back and realized that he had forgotten entirely about the status-setting. Biggest was glowering at him. Hunker stood guard, confused at his new leader’s sudden loss of interest in the confrontation—and to gesture at a mere fem, too.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari reared up as tall as he could and waved the stone. This produced the desired effect. Biggest inched back a bit and the rest of the troop edged closer. Hari made Ipan stalk forward boldly. By this time it did not take much effort, for Ipan was enjoying this enormously.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest retreated. Fems inched around Biggest and approached Ipan.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">If only I could leave him to the fems’ delights,</span> Hari thought.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He tried to bail out again. Nothing. The mechanism wasn’t working back at the Excursion Station. And something told him that it wasn’t going to get fixed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He gave the edged stone to Hunker. The pan seemed surprised, but took it. Hari hoped the symbolism of the gesture would penetrate in some fashion, because he had no time left to spend on pan politics. Hunker hefted the rock and looked at Ipan. Then he cried in a rolling, powerful voice, tones rich in joy and triumph.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was quite happy to let Hunker distract the troop. He took Sheelah by the arm and led her into the trees. No one followed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He was relieved. If another pan had tagged along, it would have confirmed his suspicions. Vaddo might be keeping track.</span></p><a id="page397"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Still, he reminded himself, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</span></p>
