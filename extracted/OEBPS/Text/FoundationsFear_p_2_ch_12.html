      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Marq puffed the packet into his nose and waited for the rush.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That bad?” Nim signaled the Splashes &amp; Sniffs mechmaid for another.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Voltaire,” Marq grumbled. He reached the top of the stim lift, his mind getting sharper and somehow at the same time lazier. He had never quite worked out how that could be. “He’s supposed to be my creature, but half the time it’s like I’m <span class="italic">his.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He’s a bunch of numbers.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sure, but…Once I eavesdropped on his subconscious sentence-forming Agent, and he was framing a bunch of stuff about ‘will is soul’—self-image maintenance stuff, I think.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Philosophy, could be.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Will</span> he’s got, for sure. So I’ve created a being with a soul?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Category error,” Nim said. “You’re abstracting ‘soul’ out of Agents. That’s like trying to go from atoms to cows in one jump.”</span></p><a id="page150"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“That’s the kind of leap this sim makes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You want to understand a cow, you don’t look for cow-atoms.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Right, you go for the ‘emergent property.’ Standard theory.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This sim is <span class="italic">predictable,</span> buddy. Remember that. You tailor him until he’s got no nonlinear elements you can’t contain.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq nodded. “He’s…different. So powerful.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He got simmed for a reason, way back in the Dark Ages somewhere. Did you expect a doormat? One who wouldn’t give you a hard time? You represent authority—which he battled all his life.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq ran fingers through his wavy hair. “Sure, if I find a nonlinear constellation I can’t abstract out—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“—call it a will or a soul and <span class="italic">delete it.</span>” Nim slapped the table hard, making a woman nearby give them a startled glance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq gave him a mocking, skeptical look. “The system isn’t completely predictable.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So you launch a pattern-sniffer. Back-trace on it. Stitch in sub-Agents, handcuff any personas you can’t fix. Hey, you <span class="italic">invented</span> those cognitive constraint algorithms. You’re the best.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq nodded. <span class="italic">And what if it’s like cutting into a brain in search of consciousness?</span> He took a deep breath and exhaled toward the domed ceiling, where a mindless entertainment played, presumably for those conked off on stiff. “Anyway, it’s not just him.” Marq met Nim’s eyes. “I rigged Sybyl’s office. I eavesdrop on her meetings with Boker.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim slapped him on the shoulder. “Good for you!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq laughed. A buddy sticks with you, even if you’re having a stupid-storm. “That isn’t all.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim leaned forward, boyishly curious.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I think I went too far,” Marq said.</span></p><a id="page151"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“You got caught!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, no. You know how Sybyl is. She doesn’t suspect intrigue from enemies, much less friends.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Maneuvering isn’t her strong suit.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m not sure it’s mine, either,” Marq said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ummm.” Nim gave him a shrewd look, eyes half-closed. “So…what else did you do?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq sighed. “I updated Voltaire. Gave him cross-learning programs to flesh out his deep conflicts, help him reconcile them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim’s eyes widened. “Risky.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I wanted to see what a mind like that could do. When will I get another chance?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How do you feel about it, though?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq chuffed Nim on the shoulder to hide his embarrassment.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Kinda rotten. Sybyl and I both agreed not to do it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Faith doesn’t need to be too smart.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I thought of that excuse, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s that guy Seldon think of all this?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We…haven’t told him.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He wants it that way! Keeps his hands clean.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim nodded. “Look buddy, deed’s done. How did the sim take it?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Jolted him. Big oscillations on the neural nets.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Okay now, though?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Seems so. I think he’s reintegrated.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Does your client know?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes. The Skeptics are all for it. I foresee no problem there.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re doing real research on this one,” Nim said. “Good for the field. <span class="italic">Important.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So how come I feel like having maybe a dozen or so sniffs?” He jerked a thumb at the moron movie on the ceiling. “So that I’ll loll back and think that’s terrif stuff?”</span></p>
