      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“We’re certainly related, yes,” Expert Specialist Vaddo said. He was a big man, tanned and muscular and casually confident. He was a safari guide and immersion specialist, with a biology background. He did research using immersion techniques, but keeping the station going soaked up most of his time, he said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari looked skeptical. “You think pans were with us back on an Earth?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sure. Had to be.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They could not have arisen from genetic tinkering with our own kind?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Doubtful. Genetic inventory shows that they come from a small stable, probably a zoo set up here. Or else an accidental crash.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors asked, “Is there any chance this world could have been the original Earth?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo chuckled. “No fossil record, no ruins. Anyway, the local fauna and flora have a funny key-pattern in their genetic helix, a bit different from our DNA. Extra methyl group on the purine rings. We can live here, eat the food, but neither we nor the pans are native.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo made a good case. Pans certainly looked<a id="page350"></a> quasihuman. Ancient records referred to a classification, that was all: Pan troglodytes, whatever that meant in a long-lost tongue. They had hands with thumbs, the same number of teeth as humans, no tails.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo waved a big hand at the landscape below the station. “They were dumped here along with plenty of other related species, on top of a biosphere that supported the usual grasses and trees, very little more.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How long ago?” Dors asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Over thirteen thousand years, that’s for sure.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Before Trantor’s consolidation. But other planets don’t have pans,” Dors persisted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo nodded. “I guess in the early Empire days nobody thought they were useful.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Are they?” Hari asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not that I can tell.” Vaddo shrugged. “We haven’t tried training them much, beyond research purposes. Remember, they’re supposed to be kept wild. The original Emperor’s Boon stipulated that.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Tell me about your research,” Hari said. In his experience, no scientist ever passed up a chance to sing his own song. He was right.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They had taken human DNA and pan DNA—Vaddo said, waxing on enthusiastically—then unzipped the double helix strands in both. Linking one human strand with a pan strand made a hybrid.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Where the strands complemented, the two then tightly bound in a partial, new double helix. Where they differed, bonding between the strands was weak, intermittent, with whole sections flapping free.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then they spun the watery solutions in a centrifuge, so the weak sections ripped apart. Closely linked DNA was 98.2 percent of the total. Pans were startlingly like humans. Less than two percent<a id="page351"></a> difference, about the same that separated men and women—yet they lived in forests and invented nothing.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The typical difference between individual people’s DNA was a tenth of a percentage point, Vaddo said. Roughly, then, pans were twenty times more different from humans than particular people differed among themselves—genetically.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But genes were like levers, supporting vast weights by pivoting about a small fulcrum.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So you think they came before us?” Dors was impressed. “On Earth?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo nodded vigorously. “They must have been related, but we don’t come from them. We parted company, genetically, six million years ago.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And do they think like us?” Hari asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Best way to tell is an immersion,” Vaddo said. “Very best way.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He smiled invitingly and Hari wondered if Vaddo got a commission on immersions. His sales pitch was subtle, shaped for an academic’s interest, but still a sales pitch.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo had already made available to Hari the vast stores of data on pan movements, population dynamics, and behaviors. It was a rich source, millennia old. With some modeling, here might be fertile ground for a simple description of pans as protohumans, using a truncated version of psychohistory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Describing the life history of a species mathematically is one thing,” Dors said. “But <span class="italic">living</span> in it…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Come now,” Hari said. Even though he knew the entire Excursion Station was geared to sell the guests safaris and immersions, he was intrigued. “I need a change, you said. Get out of stuffy old Trantor, you said.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo smiled warmly. “It’s completely safe.”</span></p><a id="page352"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors smiled at Hari tolerantly. Between people long-married there is a diplomacy of the eyes. “Oh, all right.”</span></p>
