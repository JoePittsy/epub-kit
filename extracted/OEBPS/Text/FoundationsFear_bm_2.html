    <p class="paraNoIndent"><span><span class="bold">Gregory Benford</span>—physicist, educator, author—was born in Mobile Alabama. He is a professor of physics at the University of California-Irvine, and conducts research in plasma turbulence theory and experiment, and in astrophysics. He has published well over a hundred papers. He is a Woodrow Wilson Fellow and a visiting professor at Cambridge University and has served as an advisor to the Department of Energy, NASA, and the White House Council on Space Policy.</span></p>

    <p class="para"><span>Many of his best-known novels are part of a six-novel sequence beginning in the near future with <span class="italic">In the Ocean of Night</span>, and continuing on with <span class="italic">Across the Sea of Suns</span>. The series then leaps to the far future, at the center of our galaxy, where a desperate human drama unfolds, beginning with <span class="italic">Great Sky River</span>, and proceeding through <span class="italic">Tides of Light, Furious Gulf</span>, and concluding with <span class="italic">Sailing Bright Eternity</span>. At the series’ end the links to the earlier novels emerge, revealing a single unfolding tapestry against an immense background.</span></p>
