      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>He had another stim to calm himself. Somehow he was more jittery afterward than during the social collision. Lamurk had given Hari a cold, angry stare as they parted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ll keep track of him,” Dors said. “You just enjoy your fame.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To Hari this was a flat impossibility, but he tried. Seldom did one see such a variety of people, and he calmed himself by lapsing into a habitual role: polite observer. It was not as though the usual social chitchat demanded much concentration. A warm smile would do most of the work for him here.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The party was a microcosm of Trantorian society. In spare moments, Hari watched the social orders interact.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon’s grandfather had reinstated many Ruellian traditions, and one of those customs required that members of all five classes be present at any grand Imperial function. Cleon seemed especially keen on this practice, as if it would raise his popularity among the masses. Hari kept his own doubts private.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>First and obvious came the gentry—the inherited aristocracy. Cleon himself stood at the apex of a pyramid of rank that descended from the Imperium to mighty Quadrant Dukes and Spiral Arm Princes, past<a id="page52"></a> Life Peers, all the way down to the local barons Hari used to know back on Helicon.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Working in the fields, he had seen them pompously scudding overhead. Each governed a domain no larger than they could cross by flitter in a day. To a member of the gentry, life was busy with the Great Game—a ceaseless campaign to advance the fortunes of one’s noble house, arranging greater status for your family line through political alliances, or marriages for your many children.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari snorted in derision, masking it by taking another stim. He had studied anthropological reports from a thousand Fallen Worlds—those that had devolved in isolation, reverting to cruder ways of life. He knew this pyramid-shaped order to be among the most natural and enduring human social patterns. Even when a planet was reduced to simple agriculture and hand-forged metals, the same triangular format endured. People <span class="italic">liked</span> rank and order.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The endless competition of gentry families had been the first and easiest psychohistorological system Hari ever modeled. He had first combined basic game theory and kin selection. Then, in a moment of inspiration, he inserted them into the equations that described sand grains skidding down the slopes of a dune. That correctly described sudden transitions: social slippages.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So it was with the rise and fall of noble family lines. Long, smooth eras—then abrupt shifts.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He watched the crowd, picking out those in the second aristocracy, supposedly equal to the first: the meritocracy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As department chairman at a major Imperial university, Hari was himself a lord in that hierarchy—a pyramid of achievement rather than of birth. Meritocrats had entirely different obsessions than<a id="page53"></a> the gentry’s constant dynastic bickerings. In fact, few in Hari’s class bothered to breed at all, so busy were they in their chosen fields. Gentry jostled for the top ranks of Imperial government, while second tier meritocrats saw themselves wielding the <span class="italic">real</span> power.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">If only Cleon had such a role in mind for me,</span> Hari thought. A vice minister position, or an advisory post. He could have managed that for a time, or else bungled it and got himself forced out of office. Either way, he would be safe back at Streeling within a year or two. They don’t execute vice ministers…not for incompetence, at least.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nor did a vice minister feel the worst burden of rule—bearing responsibility for the lives of a quadrillion human beings.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors saw him drifting along in his own thoughts. Under her gentle urging, he sampled tasty savories and made small talk.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The gentry could be distinguished by their ostentatiously fashionable clothing, while the economists, generals and other meritocrats tended to wear the formal garb of their professions.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So he was making a political statement, after all, Hari realized. In wearing professor’s robes, he emphasized that there might be a non-gentry First Minister for the first time in forty years.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Not that he minded making that statement. Hari just wished he had done it on purpose.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Despite the official Ruellian ethos, the remaining three social classes seemed nearly invisible at the party.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The factotums wore somber costumes of brown or gray, with expressions to match. They seldom spoke on their own. Usually they hovered at the elbow of some aristo, supplying facts and even figures that the more gaily-dressed guests used in their arguments. Aristos<a id="page54"></a> generally were innumerate, unable to do simple addition. <span class="italic">That</span> was for machines.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari found that he actually had to concentrate in order to pick the fourth class, the Greys, out of the crowd. He watched them move, like finches among peacocks.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yet their kind made up more than a sixth of Trantor’s population. Drawn from every planet in the Empire by the all-seeing Civil Service tests, they came to the Capital World, served their time like bachelor monks, and left again for outworld postings. Flowing through Trantor like water in the gloomy cisterns, the Greys were seldom thought of, as honest and commonplace and dull as the metal walls.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That might have been his life, he realized. It was the way out of the fields for many of the brighter children he had known at Helicon. Except that Hari had been plucked right over the bureaucracy, sent straight to academe by the time he could solve a mere eighth-order tensor defoliation, at age ten.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ruellianism preached that “citizen” was the highest social class of all. In theory, even the Emperor shared sovereignty with common men and women.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But at a party like this, the most numerous Galactic group was represented mostly by the servants carrying food and drink around the hall, even more invisible than the dour bureaucrats. The majority of Trantor’s population, the laborers and mechanics and shopkeepers—the denizens of the 800 Sectors—had no station at a gathering like this. They lay outside the Ruellian ranking.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As for the Artes, that final social order was not meant to be invisible. Musicians and jugglers strolled among the guests, the smallest, most flamboyant class.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Even more dashing was an air-sculptor Hari spotted across the vast chamber, when Dors pointed him out. Hari had heard of the new art<a id="page55"></a> form. The “statues” were of colored smoke that the artist exhaled in rapid puffs. Shapes of eerie, ghostlike complexity floated among the bemused guests. Some figures clearly made fun of the courtly gentry, as puffy caricatures of their ostentatious clothes and poses.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To Hari’s eye, the smoke figures seemed entrancing…until they started drifting apart into tatters, without substance or predictability.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s all the mode,” he heard one onlooker remark. “I hear the artist comes straight from Sark!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Renaissance world?” another asked, wide-eyed. “Isn’t that a little daring? Who invited him?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Emperor himself, it’s said.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari frowned. Sark, where those personality simulations came from. “Renaissance world,” he muttered irritably, knowing now what he disliked about the smoke shapes: their ephemeral nature. Their intended destiny, to dissolve into chaos.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As he watched, the air-sculptor blew a satirical tableau. The first figure formed of crimson smoke, and he did not recognize it until Dors elbowed him and laughed. “It’s you!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He clamped his gaping mouth shut, unsure how to handle the social nuances. A second cloud of coiling blue streamers formed a clear picture of Lamurk, eyebrows knotted in fury. The foggy figures hovered in confrontation, Hari smiling, Lamurk scowling.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And Lamurk looked the fool, with bulging eyes and pouting lips.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Time for a graceful exit,” Hari’s lieutenant whispered. Hari was only too glad to agree.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>When they got home, he was sure that there had been a bit extra in the stim he was handed, something that freed his tongue. Certainly it was not the slow-spoken, reflective Seldon who had traded jabs with Lamurk. He would have to watch that.</span></p><a id="page56"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors simply shook her head. “It was you. Just a portion of you that doesn’t get out to play very much.”</span></p>
