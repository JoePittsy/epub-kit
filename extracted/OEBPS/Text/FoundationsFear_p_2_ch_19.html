      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Voltaire <span class="italic">loved</span> audiences. And he had never appeared before one like this ocean of faces lapping at his feet.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Although tall in his former life, he felt that only now, gazing down at the multitudes from his hundred-meter height, had he achieved the stature he deserved. He patted his powdered wig and fussed with the shiny satin ribbon at his throat. With a gracious flourish of his hands, he made a deep bow to them, as if he’d already given the performance of his life. The crowd murmured like an awakening beast.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He glanced at the Maid, concealed from the audience behind a shimmering partition in the far corner of the screen. She folded her arms, pretending to be unimpressed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Delay only excited the beast. He let the crowd cheer and stamp, ignoring boos and hisses from approximately half of those present.</span></p><a id="page171"></a>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">At least half of humanity has always been fools,</span> he reflected. This was his first exposure to the advanced denizens of this colossal Empire. Millennia had made no difference.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He was not one to prematurely cut off adulation he knew was his due. Here he stood for the epitome of the French intellectual tradition, now vanquished but for him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He gazed again at Joan—who was, after all, the only other surviving member of their time, quite obviously the peak in human civilization. He whispered, “’Tis our destiny to shine; theirs, to applaud.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>When the moderator finally pleaded for silence—a bit too soon; Voltaire would take that up with him later—Voltaire endured Joan’s introduction with what he hoped was a stoic smile. He elaborately insisted that Joan make her points first, only to have the moderator rather rudely tell him that here, they flipped a coin.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire won. He shrugged, then placed his hand over his heart. He began his recital in the declamatory style so dear to eighteenth-century Parisian hearts: no matter how defined the soul, like a deity, could not be shown to exist; its existence was inferred.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Truth of the inference lay beyond rational proof. Nor was there anything in Nature that required it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And yet, Voltaire continued to pontificate, there was nothing more obvious in Nature than the work of an intelligence greater than man’s—which man is able, within limits, to decipher. That man can decode Nature’s secrets proved what the Church fathers and all the founders of the world’s great religions had always said: that man’s intelligence is a reflection of that same Divine Intelligence which authored Nature.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Were this not so, natural philosophers could not<a id="page172"></a> discern the laws behind Creation, either because there would be none, or because man would be so alien to them that he could not discern them. The very harmony between natural law, and our ability to discover it, strongly suggested that sages and priests of all persuasions are essentially correct!—in arguing that we are but the creatures of an Almighty Power, whose Power is reflected in us. And this reflection in us of that Power may be justly termed our universal, immortal, yet individual souls.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re praising priests!” the Maid exclaimed. She was swamped by the pandemonium that broke out in the crowd.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The operation of chance,” Voltaire concluded, “in no way proves that Nature and Man—who is part of Nature and as such a reflection of its Creator—are somehow accidental. Chance is one of the principles through which natural law <span class="italic">works.</span> That principle may correspond with the traditional religious view that man is free to chart his own course. But this freedom, even when apparently random, obeys statistical laws in a way that man can comprehend.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The crowd muttered, confused. They needed an aphorism, he saw, to firm them up. Very well. “Uncertainty is certain, my friends. Certainty is uncertain.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Still they did not quiet, to better hear his words. Very well, again.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He clenched both fists and belted out in a voice of surprising bass power, “Man is, like Nature itself, free and determined both at once—as religious sages have been telling us for centuries though, to be sure, they use a different vocabulary, far less precise than ours. Much mischief and misunderstanding between religion and science stem from that.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ve been greatly misunderstood,” Voltaire resumed. “I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize<a id="page173"></a> for distortions resulting because all I said and wrote focused only on errors of faith, <span class="italic">not</span> on its intuited truths. But I lived during an era in which errors of faith were rife, while reason’s voice had to fight to be heard. Now, the opposite appears to be true. Reason mocks faith. Reason shouts while faith whispers. As the execution of France’s greatest and most faithful heroine proved—” a grand, sweeping gesture to Joan “—faith without reason is blind. But, as the superficiality and vanity of much of my life and work prove, reason without faith is lame.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Some who had booed and hissed now blinked, mouths agape—and then cheered…while, he noticed, those who had applauded, now booed and hissed. Voltaire stole a look at the Maid.</span></p>
