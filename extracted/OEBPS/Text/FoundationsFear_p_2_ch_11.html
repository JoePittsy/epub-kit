      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“Your orders,” said Garçon 213-ADM with a flourish.</span></p><a id="page147"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>He was having difficulty following the arguments between the Maid and the Monsieur on whether beings like himself possessed a soul. Monsieur seemed to believe that no one at all had a soul—which outraged the Maid. They argued with such heat they did not notice the disappearance of the odd ghost presence who usually watched them, a “programmer” of this space.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Now was Garçon’s chance to implore Monsieur to intervene on his behalf and ask his human masters to give him a name. 213-ADM was just a mechfolk code: 2 identified his function, mechwaiter; 13 placed him in this Sector, and ADM stood for <span class="italic">Aux Deux Magots.</span> He was sure he’d have a better chance of attracting the honey-haired short-order cook’s attention if he had a <span class="italic">human</span> name.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Monsieur, Madame. Your orders, please.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What good is ordering?” Monsieur snapped. Patience, Garçon observed, was not improved by learning. “We cannot taste a thing!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon gestured sympathetically with two of his four hands. He had no experience of human senses except sight, sound, and rudimentary touch, those necessary to perform his job. He would have given anything to taste, to feel; humans seemed to derive such pleasure from it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid perused the menu and, changing the subject, said, “I’ll have my usual. A crust of bread—I’ll try a sourdough baguette crust for a change—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“A sourdough baguette!” Monsieur echoed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“—and, to dip it in, a bit of champagne.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur shook his hand as if to cool it off. “I commend you, Garçon, for doing such a fine job of teaching the Maid to read the menu.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Madame La Scientiste permitted it,” Garçon said; he did not want trouble with his human masters, who could pull the plug on him at any time.</span></p><a id="page148"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur waved a dismissive hand. “She’s much too detail-obsessed. She’d never survive on her own in Paris, much less at any royal court. Marq, however, will go far. Lack of scruples is fortune’s favorite grease. I certainly did not proceed from penury to being one of the wealthiest citizens in France by confusing ideals with scruples.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Has Monsieur decided on his order?” Garçon asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes. You’re to instruct the Maid in more advanced texts so that she can read my poem, ‘On the Newtonian Philosophy,’ along with all my <span class="italic">Lettres Philosophiques.</span> Her reasoning is to become as equal as possible with my own. Not that anyone’s reason is likely to become so,” he added with his cocky smile.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Your modesty is equaled only by your wit,” said the Maid, drawing from Monsieur a smirky laugh.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon sadly shook his head. “I’m afraid that won’t be possible. I am unable to instruct anyone except in simple phrases. My literacy permits comprehension of nothing beyond menus. I’m honored by Monsieur’s desire to advance my station. But even when opportunity knocks, I and my kind, consigned forever to the lowest levels of society, cannot answer the door.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The lower classes ought to keep their place,” Voltaire assured him. “But I’ll make an exception in your case. You seem ambitious. Are you?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon glanced at the honey-haired cook. “Ambition is unsuited to one of my rank.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What would you be, then? If you could be anything you like?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon happened to know that the cook spent her three days a week off—Garçon himself worked seven days a week—in the corridors of the Louvre. “A<a id="page149"></a> mechguide at the Louvre,” he said. “One smart enough, and with sufficient leisure, to court a woman who barely knows I exist.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur said grandly, “I’ll find a way to—how do they say it?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Download him,” the Maid volunteered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Mon dieu!</span>” Monsieur exclaimed. “Already she can read as well as you. But I will not have her wit exceed mine! That would be going too damned far, in-deed!”</span></p>
