      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“I need to see Daneel,” Hari insisted. He felt a bit blurry from his raw interface with the sprawling, dizzying Mesh. But there was little time. “Now.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors shook her head. “Far too dangerous, particularly with the tiktok crisis so—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I can solve that. Get him.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m not sure how to—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I love you, but you’re a terrible liar.”</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Daneel was wearing a workman’s pullover and looking quite uncomfortable when Hari met him in a broad, busy plaza.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Where are your Specials?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“All around us, dressed much as you are.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This made Daneel even more uneasy. Hari realized that this most advanced of robot forms suffered from some eternal human limitations. With facial expressions activated, even a positronic brain could not<a id="page547"></a> separately control the subtleties of lips and eyes while experiencing disconnected emotions. And in public Daneel did not dare let his subprograms lapse and his face go blank.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They have a sonic wall up?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari nodded to the captain, who was pushing a broom nearby. Daneel’s words seemed to come through a blanket. “I do not like to expose us this way.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Knots of Specials astutely deflected passersby so that none noticed the sonic bubble. Hari had to admire the masterly method; the Empire could still do some things expertly. “Matters are worse than even you imagine.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Your request, to provide moment-to-moment location data of Lamurk’s people—this could expose my agents inside the Lamurk network.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There’s no other way,” Hari said sharply. “I’ll leave to you tracking the right figures.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They must be incapacitated?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For the rest of the crisis.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Which</span> crisis?” Daneel’s face wrenched into a grimace—then went blank. He had cut the connections.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The tiktoks. Lamurk’s moves. A bit of blackmail, for spice. Sark. Take your pick. Oh, and aspects of the Mesh I’ll describe later.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You will force a predictable pattern on the Lamurk factions? How?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“With a maneuver. I imagine your agents will be able to predict positions of some principals, including Lamurk himself, at that time.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What maneuver?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I will send a signal when it is about to transpire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You jest with me,” Daneel said darkly. “And the other request, to eliminate Lamurk himself—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Choose your method. I shall choose mine.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I can do that, true. An application of the Zeroth<a id="page548"></a> Law.” Daneel paused, face slack, in high calculation mode. “My method will take five minutes of preparation at the site we choose, to bring off the effect.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Good enough. Just be sure your robots keep the leading Lamurkians well spotted, and the data flowing through Dors.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Tell me now!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And spoil the anticipation?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hari, you <span class="italic">must</span>—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Only if you can be absolutely <span class="italic">sure</span> there will be no leaks.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nothing is utterly certain—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Then we have free will, no? Or at least I do.” Hari felt an unfamiliar zest. To <span class="italic">act</span>—that gave a kind of freedom, too.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Though Daneel’s face showed nothing, his body language spoke of caution: his legs crossing, a hand touching his face. “I need some assurance that you fully understand the situation.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari laughed. He had never done that in the solemn presence of Daneel. It felt like a liberation.</span></p>
