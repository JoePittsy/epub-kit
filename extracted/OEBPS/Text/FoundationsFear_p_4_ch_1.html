      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Joan of Arc floated down the dim, rumbling tunnels of the smoky Mesh.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She fought down her fears. Around her played a complex spatter of fractured light and clapping, hollow implosions.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Thought was a chain unfixed in time and unanchored in space. But, like tinkling currents, alabaster pious images formed—restless, churning. An unending flux, dissolving structures in her wake, as if she were a passing ship.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She would be hugely pleased, indeed, to have so concrete a self. Anxiously she studied the murky Mesh that streamed about her like ocean whorls of liquid mahogany.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Since her escape from the wizards, upon whom the preservation of her soul—her “consciousness,” a term somehow unconnected to conscience—depended, she had surrendered to these wet coursings. Her saintly mother had once told her that this was how the churning waters of a great river succumb, roiling into their beds deep in the earth.</span></p><a id="page290"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Now she floated as an airy spirit, self-absorbed, sufficient to herself, existing outside the tick of time.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Stasis-space,</span> Voltaire had termed it. A sanctuary where she could <span class="italic">minimize computational clock time</span>—such odd language!—waiting for visions from Voltaire.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>At his last appearance, he had been frustrated—and all because she preferred her internal voices to his own!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>How could she explain that, despite her will, the voices of saints and archangels so compelled her? That they drowned out those who sought to penetrate her from outside?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A simple peasant, she could not resist great spirit-beings like the no-nonsense St. Catherine. Or stately Michael, King of Angel Legions, greater than the royal French armies that she herself had led into battle. (<span class="italic">Eons ago,</span> an odd voice whispered—yet she was sure this was mere illusion, for time surely was suspended in this Purgatory.)</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Especially she could not resist when their spirit-speech thundered with one voice—as now.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ignore him,” Catherine said, the instant Voltaire’s request for audience arrived. She hovered on great white wings.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire’s manifestation here was a dove of peace, brilliant white, winging toward her from the sullen liquid. Blithe bird!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Catherine’s no-nonsense voice cut crisply, as stiff as the black-and-white habit of a meticulous nun. “You sinfully surrendered to his lust, but that does not mean that he owns you. You don’t belong to a man! You belong to your Creator.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The bird chirped, “I must send you a freight of data.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I, I…” Joan’s small voice echoed, as if she were in a vast cavern, not a vortex river at all. If she could only <span class="italic">see</span>—</span></p><a id="page291"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Catherine’s great wings batted angrily. “He will go away. He has no choice. He cannot reach you, cannot make you sin—unless you consent.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan’s cheeks burned as the memory of her lewdness with Voltaire rushed in.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Catherine is right,” a deep voice thundered—Michael, King of the Angel Hosts of Heaven. “Lust has nothing to do with bodies, as you and the man proved. His body stank and rotted long ago.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It would be good to see him again,” Joan whispered longingly. Here, thoughts were somehow actions. She had but to raise a hand and Voltaire’s numerics would transfix her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He offers defiling data!” Catherine cried. “Deflect his intrusion at once.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“If you cannot resist him, marry him,” Michael ordered stiffly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Marry?” St. Catherine’s voice sputtered with contempt.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In bodily life, she had affected male attire, cropped her hair, and refused to have anything to do with men, thus demonstrating her holiness and good sense. Joan had prayed to St. Catherine often. “Males! Even here,” the saint scolded Michael, “you stick together to wage war and ruin women.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My counsel is entirely spiritual,” said Michael loftily. “I’m an angel and thus prefer neither sex.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Catherine sputtered with contempt. “Then why aren’t you the Queen of Legions of Angels and not the King? Why don’t you command heavenly hostesses and not heavenly hosts? Why aren’t you an archangela instead of an archangel? And why isn’t your name Michelle?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Please,</span> Joan said. <span class="italic">Please.</span> The thought of marriage struck as much terror in her soul as in St. Catherine’s, even if marriage <span class="italic">was</span> one of the blessed<a id="page292"></a> sacraments. But then so was extreme unction, and <span class="italic">that</span> one almost always meant certain death.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>…<span class="italic">flames</span>…the priest’s leer as he administered the rites…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>crackling horror, terrible cutting, licking <span class="italic">flames</span>…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She shook herself—<span class="italic">assembled her Self,</span> came a whisper—and focused on her saintly host. Oh yes, marriage…Voltaire…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She was not sure <span class="italic">what</span> marriage meant, besides bearing children in Christ and in agony, for Holy Mother Church. The act of getting children, begetting, aroused in her a thumping heart, weak legs, images of the lean, clever man…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It means being owned,” Catherine said. “It means instead of needing your consent when he wants to impose on you—like now—were Voltaire your husband, he could break in on you whenever he likes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Existence without selfdom, without privacy…Bursts of Joan’s bright self-light collided, flickered, dimmed, almost guttered out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Are you suggesting,” Michael said, “that she continue to receive this apostate without subjecting their lust to the bonds of marriage? Let them marry and extinguish their lust completely!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan could not be heard over the bickering of saints and angels in the musty, liquid murk. She knew that in this arithmetic Limbo, like a waiting room for true Purgatory, she had no heart…but something, somewhere, nevertheless ached.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Memories flooded her. His lean, quick self. Surely a saint and an archangel would forgive her if she took advantage of their sacred bickering to grant Voltaire’s request that his “data” be received, if she surrendered—just this once—to impulses compelling her from within.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Shuddering, she yielded.</span></p>
