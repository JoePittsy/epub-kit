      <p class="para"><span>That Biggest, he walks by, gets respect right away. Plenty. Fems and guys alike, they stick out their hands.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest touches them, taking time with each, letting them know he is there. The world is all right.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I reach out to him, too. Makes me feel good. I want to be like Biggest, to be big, be as big as him, be <span class="italic">him.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Fems don’t give him any trouble. He wants one, she goes. Hump right away. He’s Biggest.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Most males, they don’t get much respect. Fems don’t want to do with them as much as they do with Biggest. The little males, they huff and throw sand and all that, but everybody knows they’re not going to be much. No chance they could ever be like<a id="page364"></a> Biggest. They don’t like that, but they are stuck with it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Me, I’m pretty big. I get respect. Some, anyway.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>All the guys like stroking. Petting. Grooming. Fems give it to them and they give it back.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Guys get more, though. After it, they’re not so gruff.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I’m sitting getting groomed and all of a sudden I smell something. I don’t like it. I jump up, cry out. Biggest, he takes notice. Smells it, too.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Strangers. Everybody starts hugging each other. Strong smell, plenty of it. Lots of Strangers. The wind says they are near, getting nearer.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They come running down on us from the ridge. Looking for fems, looking for trouble.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I run for my rocks. I always have some handy. I fling one at them, miss. Then they in among us. It’s hard to hit them, they go so fast.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Four Strangers, they grab two fems. Drag them away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Everybody howling, crying. Dust everywhere.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I throw rocks. Biggest leads the guys against the Strangers.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They turn and run off. Just like that. Got the two fems though and that’s bad.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest mad. He pushes around some of the guys, makes noise. He not looking so good now, he let the Strangers in.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Those Strangers bad. We all hunker<a id="page365"></a> down, groom each other, pet, make nice sounds.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Biggest, he come by, slap some of the fems. Hump some. Make sure everybody know he’s still Biggest.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He don’t slap me. He know better than to try. I growl at him when he come close and he pretend not to hear.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Maybe he not so Big anymore, I’m thinking.</span></p>
