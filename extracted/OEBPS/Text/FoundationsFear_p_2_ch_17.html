      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Marq tuned Nim in on the interoffice screen. “Did it! From now on, he’ll be able to say anything he wants. I’ve deleted every scrape with authority he ever had.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Attaway,” said Nim, grinning.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Think I should delete run-ins with his father, too?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m not sure,” Nim said. “What were they like?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Pretty hot. His father was a strict disciplinarian, sympathetic to the ‘Jansenist’ view.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s that? A sports team?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I asked. He said, ‘A Catholic version of a Protestant.’ I don’t think they were teams. Something about sin being everywhere, pleasure’s disgusting—usual primitive religion, Dark Ages stuff.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim grinned. “Most stuff’s only disgusting when it’s done right.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq laughed. “Too true. Still, maybe he first experienced the threat of censorship from his old man.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim paused to reflect. “You’re worried about instabilities in the character-space, right?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Could happen.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But you want killer instinct, right?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq nodded. “I can put in some editing algorithms to police instabilities.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Right. Not like you need him totally sane after the debate’s over, or anything.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Might as well go for broke. Can’t hurt.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq frowned. “I wonder…should we go through with this?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hey, what choice we got? Junin Sector wants a trial of champions, we ship them one. Done deal.”</span></p><a id="page167"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“But if Imperial types come after us for illegal sims—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I <span class="italic">like</span> danger, passion,” Nim said. “You always agree, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, but—why are we getting smarter tiktoks now? They’re not that hard to make.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Old prohibitions wearing out, my friend. And it <span class="italic">has</span> come up, many times. Just got knocked down, is all.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“By what?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Nim shrugged. “Politics, social forces—who knows? I mean, people feel edgy about machines that think. Can’t trust them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What if you couldn’t even tell they were machines?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Huh? That’s crazy.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Maybe a really smart machine doesn’t want any competition.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Smarter than good ol’ Marq? Doesn’t exist.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But they could…eventually.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Never. Forget it. Let’s get to work.”</span></p>
