      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Hari’s eyes snapped open.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The recovery program was still sending electro-stims through his muscles. He let them jump and tingle and ache while he thought. He felt fine. Not even hungry, as he usually did after an immersion. How long had he been in the wilderness? At least five days.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He sat up. There was no one in the vessel room. Evidently Vaddo had gotten some silent alarm but had not alerted anyone else. That pointed, again, to a tight little conspiracy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He got out shakily. To get free he had to detach some feeders and probes, but they seemed simple enough.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan. The big body filled the walkway. He knelt and felt for a pulse. Rickety.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But first, Dors. Her vessel was next to his and he started the revival. She looked well.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo must have put some transmission block on the system, so that none of the staff could tell by looking at the panel that anything was wrong. A simple cover story: a couple who wanted a really long immersion. Vaddo had warned them, but no, they wanted it, so…A perfectly plausible story.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors’ eyes fluttered. He kissed her. She gasped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He made a pan sign, <span class="italic">quiet,</span> and went back to Ipan.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Blood was flowing steadily. Hari was surprised to find that he could not pick up the rich, pungent elements in the pan’s blood from smell alone. A human missed so much!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He took off his shirt and made a crude tourniquet. At least Ipan’s breathing was regular. Dors was ready to get out by then, and he helped her disconnect.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I was hiding in a tree and then—poof!” she said. “What a relief. How did you—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Let’s get moving,” he said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As they left the room, she said, “Who can we<a id="page432"></a> trust? Whoever did this—” She stopped when she saw Vaddo. “Oh.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Somehow her expression made him laugh. She was very rarely surprised.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">You</span> did this?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ipan.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I never would have believed a pan could, could…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I doubt anyone’s been immersed this long. Not under such stress, anyway. It all just—well, it came out.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He picked up Vaddo’s weapon and studied the mechanism. A standard pistol, silenced. Vaddo had not wanted to awaken the rest of the station. That was promising. There should be people here who would spring to their aid. He started toward the building where the station personnel lived.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Wait, what about Vaddo?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m going to wake up a doctor.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They did—but Hari took him into the vessel room first, to work on Ipan. Some patchwork and injections and the doctor said Ipan would be all right. Only then did he show the man Vaddo’s body.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The doctor got angry about that, but Hari had a gun. All he had to do was point it. He didn’t say anything, just gestured with the gun.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He did not feel like talking and wondered if he ever would again. When you couldn’t talk you concentrated more, entered into things. Immersed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And in any case, Vaddo had been dead for some time.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan had done a good job. The doctor shook his head at the severe damage.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Alarms were ringing. He got an instant headache. The security officer showed up. He could see from her reaction that she had not been in on the plot. <span class="italic">Can’t connect it to the Academic Potentate, then,</span> he thought abstractly.</span></p><a id="page433"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>But how much did that prove? Imperial politics were subtle…. Dors looked at him oddly the whole time. He did not understand why, until he realized that he had not even thought about helping Vaddo first. Ipan was <span class="italic">himself,</span> in a sense he knew deeply but could not explain.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But he understood immediately when Dors wanted to go to the station wall and call to Sheelah. They brought her, too, in from the far wild darkness.</span></p>
