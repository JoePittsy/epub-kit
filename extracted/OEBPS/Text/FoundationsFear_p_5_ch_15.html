      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>The humans came swiftly, with clatters and booms.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He and Sheelah had been in the trees awhile. At Hari’s urging they had worked their way a few klicks away from the troop. Ipan and Sheelah showed rising anxiety at being separated from their troop. His teeth chattered and his eyes jerked anxiously at every suspicious movement. This was natural, for isolated pans were far more vulnerable.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The humans landing did not help.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Danger,</span> Hari signed, cupping an ear to indicate the noise of flyers landing nearby.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah signed, <span class="italic">Where go?</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She shook her head vehemently. <span class="italic">Stay here. They get us.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They would, indeed, but not in the sense she meant. Hari cut her off curtly, shaking his head. <span class="italic">Danger.</span> They had never intended to convey complicated ideas with their signs and now he felt bottled up, unable to tell her his suspicions.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari made a knife-across-throat gesture. Sheelah frowned.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He bent down and made Ipan take a stick. He had not been able to make Ipan write before, but necessity drove him now. Slowly he made the rough hands scratch out the letters. In soft loam he wrote <small>WANT US DEAD.</small></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah looked dumbfounded. Dors had probably been operating under the assumption that the failure to bail out was a temporary error. It had lasted too<a id="page398"></a> long for that.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The noisy, intrusive landing confirmed his hunch. No ordinary team would disturb the animals so much. And nobody would come after them directly. They would fix the immersion apparatus, where the real problem was.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><small>THEY KEEP US HERE, KILL PANS, THAT KILLS US. BLAME ON ANIMALS?</small></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had better arguments to back up his case. The slow accumulation of small details in Vaddo’s behavior. Suspicions, at least, about the security officer. Dors’ tiktok would block the officer from overriding the locks on their immersion capsules, and from tracing the capsule’s signal to Ipan and Sheelah.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So they were forced to go into the field. Letting them die in an “accident” while immersed in a pan might just be plausible enough to escape an investigation.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The humans went about their noisy business. They were enough, though, to make his case. Sheelah’s eyes narrowed, the big brow scowled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors-the-Defender took over. <span class="italic">Where?</span> Sheelah signed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had no sign for so abstract an idea, so he scribbled with the stick, <small>AWAY.</small> Indeed, he had no plan.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><small>I’LL CHECK,</small> she wrote in the dirt.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She set off toward the noise of humans deploying on the valley floor below. To a pan the din was a dreadful clanking irritation. Hari was not going to let her out of his sight. She waved him back, but he shook his head and followed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The bushes gave shelter as they got a view of the landing party below. A skirmish line was forming up a few hundred meters away. They were encircling the area where the troop had been. Why?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari squinted. Pan eyesight was not good for distance. Humans had been hunters once, and one<a id="page399"></a> could tell by the eyes alone.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Now, nearly everybody needed artificial eye-adds by the age of forty. Either civilization was hard on eyes, or maybe humans in prehistory had not lived long enough for eye trouble to rob them of game. Either conclusion was sobering.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The two pans watched the humans calling to one another, and in the middle of them Hari saw Vaddo. Each man and woman carried a weapon.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Beneath his fear he felt something strong, dark.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan trembled, watching the humans, a strange awe swelling in his mind. Humans seemed impossibly tall in the shimmering distance, moving with stately, swaying elegance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari floated above the surge of emotion, fending off its powerful effects. The reverence for those distant, tall figures came out of the pan’s dim past.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That surprised him until he thought it over. After all, animals were reared and taught by adults much smarter and stronger. Most species were like pans, spring-loaded by evolution to work in a dominance hierarchy. Awe was adaptive.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>When they met lofty humans with overwhelming power, able to mete out punishment and rewards—literally life and death—something like religious fervor arose in them. Fuzzy, but strong.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Atop that warm, tropical emotion floated a sense of satisfaction at simply <span class="italic">being.</span> His pan was happy to be a pan, even when seeing a being of clearly superior power and thought. Ironic, Hari thought.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His pan had just disproved another supposedly human earmark: their self-congratulatory distinction of being the only animal that congratulated itself.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He jerked himself out of his abstractions. How human, to ruminate even when in mortal danger.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><small>CAN’T FIND US ELECTRONICALLY,</small> he scratched in the sand.</span></p><a id="page400"></a>

      <p class="para"><span><small>MAYBE RANGE SHORT,</small> she wrote.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The first shots made them jerk.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The humans had found their pan troop. Cries of fear mingled with the sharp, harsh barks of blasters.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Go. We go,</span> he signed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah nodded and they crept quickly away. Ipan trembled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The pan was deeply afraid. Yet he was also sad, as if reluctant to leave the presence of the revered humans, his steps dragging.</span></p>
