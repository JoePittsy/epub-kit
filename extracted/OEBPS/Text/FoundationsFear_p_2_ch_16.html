      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Voltaire cackled with satisfaction. The café appeared, popping into luminous reality, independent of his human masters’ consent or knowledge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Subroutine accomplished,</span> a small voice assured him. He made the café disappear and reappear three times more, to be sure that he had mastered the technique.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>What fools these rulers were, to think that they could make the Great Voltaire a creature of their will! But now came the real test, the intricate procedure that would bring forth the Maid in all her womanly unfathomability—which, however, he was determined to fathom.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had mastered the intricate logics of this place, given the capacities the man-scientist had given him. Did they think he was some animal, unable to apply blithe reason to their labyrinths of logic? He had found his way, traced the winding electronic pathways, devised the commands. Newton had been just as difficult, and he had encompassed that, had he not?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Now, the Maid. He did his digital dance, its logics, and—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She popped into the café.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You scum,” she said, lance drawn.</span></p><a id="page163"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Not quite the greeting he’d expected. But then he saw the copy of ‘<span class="italic">La Pucelle</span>’ dangling on the point of her lance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Chérie,</span>” he cooed; whatever the offense, best to get in an apology early. “I can explain.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That’s your whole problem,” the Maid said. “You explain and explain and explain! Your plays are more tedious than the sermons I was forced to listen to in the cemetery at St. Ouen. Your railings against the sacred mysteries of the Church reveal a shallow, unfeeling mind bereft of awe and wonder.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You mustn’t take it personally,” Voltaire pleaded. “It was directed at hypocritical reverence for you—and at the superstitions of religion. My friend, Thieriot—he added passages more profane and obscene than any I had written. He needed money. He made a living reciting the poem in various salons. My poor virgin became an infamous whore, made to say gross and intolerable things.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid did not lower her lance. Instead, she poked it several times against Voltaire’s satin waist-coated chest.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">Chérie,</span>” he said. “If you knew how much I paid for this vest.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You mean, how much <span class="italic">Fred</span>erick paid—that pitiful, promiscuous, profligate pervert of a man.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Alliteration a bit heavy,” Voltaire said, “but otherwise, a quite nicely turned phrase.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His newly gained skills meant he could divest her of her lance at once, squash it. But he preferred persuasiveness to force. He quoted, with some liberty, that pleasure-hating Christian, Paul: “When I was a child, I spoke as a child, thought as a child, behaved as a child. But when I became a <span class="italic">wo</span>man, I put away manly things.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She blinked. He remembered how her inquisitors had claimed that her acceptance of the gift of a fine cloak<a id="page164"></a> was incompatible with the divine origin of her voices. In a whisk of lithe arms, Voltaire produced a Chantilly lace gown. <span class="italic">Pop</span>—and a richly embroidered cloak.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You mock me,” the Maid said. But not before he saw a gleam of interest flare in her coal-dark eyes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I long to see you as you are.” He held out the gown and cloak. “Your spirit I have no doubt is divine, but your natural form, like mine, is human; unlike mine, a woman’s.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You think I could give up the freedom of a man for <span class="italic">that</span>?” She impaled the cloak and gown on the tip of her lance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not the freedom,” Voltaire said. “Just the armor and clothes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She fell silent, pensively gazing into the distance. The crowd on the street went about their business, walking by unconcerned. Obvious wallpaper, he thought; he would have to correct that.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Perhaps a trick. She was partial to miracles. “Another little trick I’ve learned since we last met. <span class="italic">Voilà.</span> I can produce Garçon.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon popped in out of nowhere, all four of his hands free. The Maid—who had indeed once worked in a tavern, he recalled—could not help it; she smiled. She also removed the gown and cloak from the lance, tossed the lance aside, and caressed the clothes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could not resist the impulse to quote himself.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For I am man and justly proud</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In human weakness to have part;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Past mistresses have held my heart,</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>I’m happy still when thus aroused.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He fell to one knee before her. A grand gesture—foolproof, in his experience.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan gaped, speechless.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon placed both his right hands over the site where humans are supposed to have a heart. “Freedom such as yours, you offer? Monsieur,<a id="page165"></a> Mademoiselle, I appreciate your kindness, but I fear I must refuse. I cannot accept such a privilege for myself alone, while my fellows are doomed to toil in unsatisfying, dead-end jobs.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“He has a noble soul!” the Maid exclaimed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, but his brain leaves much to be desired.” Voltaire sucked reflectively at his teeth. “There has to be an underclass to do the dirty work of the elite. That is <span class="italic">natural.</span> Creating mechfolk of limited intelligence is an ideal solution! Makes one wonder why, in all their history, no one made such an obvious step…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“With all respect,” said Garçon, “unless my meager understanding fails me, Monsieur and Mademoiselle are themselves nothing more than beings of limited intelligence, created by human masters to work for the elite.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What!” Voltaire’s eyes widened.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“By what inherent right are you made more intelligent and privileged than I and others of my class? Do <span class="italic">you</span> have a soul? Should <span class="italic">you</span> be entitled to equal rights with humans, including the right to intermarry—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid made a face. “Disgusting thought.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“—to vote, to have equal access to the most sophisticated programming available?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This machine man makes more sense than many dukes I’ve known,” said the Maid, thoughtfully furrowing her brow.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I shall not have two peasants contradict me,” said Voltaire. “The rights of man are one thing; the rights of the lower orders, another.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Garçon managed to exchange a look with the Maid. This instant—before Monsieur, in a fit of pique, extinguished both her and Garçon from the screen, displacing them to a gray holding space—was retained in Garçon’s memory. Later, in his/its allowed interval for interior maintenance, the delicious moment reran again and again.</span></p>
