      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>They moved on in spite of the blunt, deep unease<a id="page415"></a> of their pans.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan smelled something that sent his eyes darting left and right. With the full tool kit of soothing thoughts and the subtle tricks he had learned, Hari kept him going.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah was having more trouble. The female pan did not like laboring up the long, steep gullies that approached the ridge line. Gnarled bushes blocked their way and it took time to work around them. Fruit was harder to find at these altitudes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan’s shoulders and arms ached constantly. Pans walked on all fours because their immensely strong arms carried a punishing weight penalty. To navigate both trees and ground meant you could optimize neither. Sheelah and Ipan groaned and whined at the soreness that never left feet, legs, wrists, and arms. Pans would never be far-ranging explorers.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Together they let their pans pause often to crumble leaves and soak up water from tree holes, a routine, simple tool use. They kept sniffing the air, apprehensive.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The smell that disturbed both pans got stronger, darker.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah went ahead and was the first over the ridge line. Far below in the valley they could make out the rectangular rigidities of the Excursion Station. A flyer lifted from the roof and whispered away down the valley, no danger to them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He recalled what seemed a century ago, sitting on the verandah there with drinks in hand and Dors saying, <span class="italic">If you stayed on Trantor you might be dead.</span> Also, if you didn’t stay on Trantor…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They started down the steep slope. Their pans’ eyes jerked at every unexpected movement. A chilly breeze stirred the few low bushes and twisted trees. Some had a feathered look, burnt and shattered by lightning. Air masses driven up from the valleys fought along here, the brute clash of pressures. This rocky ridge<a id="page416"></a> was far from the comfortable province of pans. They hurried.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ahead, Sheelah stopped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Without a sound, five raboons rose from concealment, forming a neat half circle around them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari could not tell if it was the same pack as before. If so, they were quite considerable pack hunters, able to hold memory and purpose over time. They had waited ahead, where there were no trees to climb.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The raboons were eerily quiet as they strode forward, their claws clicking softly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He called to Sheelah and made some utterly fake ferocious noises as he moved, arms high in the air, fists shaking, showing a big profile. He let Ipan take over while he thought.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A raboon band could certainly take two isolated pans. To survive this they had to surprise the raboons, frighten them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He looked around. Throwing rocks wasn’t going to do the trick here. With only a vague notion of what he was doing, he shuffled left, toward a tree that had been splintered by lightning.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah saw his move and got there first, striding energetically. Ipan picked up two stones and flung them at the nearest raboon. One struck on the flank but did no real harm.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The raboons began to trot, circling. They called to each other in wheezing grunts.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah leaped on a dried-out shard of the tree. It snapped. She snatched it up and Hari saw her point. It was as tall as she was and she cradled it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The largest raboon grunted and they all looked at each other.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The raboons charged.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The nearest one came at Sheelah. She caught it on the shoulder with the blunt point and it squealed.</span></p><a id="page417"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari grabbed a stalk of the shattered tree trunk. He could not wrench it free. Another squeal from behind him and Sheelah was gibbering in a high, frightened voice.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It was best to let the pans release tension vocally, but he could feel the fear and desperation in the tones and knew it came from Dors, too.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He carefully selected a smaller shard of the tree. With both hands he twisted it free, using his weight and big shoulder muscles, cracking it so that it came away with a point.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lances. That was the only way to stay away from the raboon claws. Pans never used such advanced weapons. Evolution hadn’t gotten around to that lesson yet.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The raboons were all around them now. He and Sheelah stood back to back. He barely got his feet placed when he had to take the rush of a big, swarthy raboon.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The raboons had not gotten the idea of the lance yet. It slammed into the point, jerked back. A fearsome bellow. Ipan wet himself with fear, but something in Hari kept him in control.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The raboon backed off, whimpering. It turned to run. In midstride it stopped. For a long, suspended moment the raboon hesitated—then turned back toward Hari.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It trotted forward with new confidence. The other raboons watched. It went to the same tree Hari had used and, with a single heave, broke off a long, slender spike of wood. Then it came toward Hari, stopped, and with one claw held the stick forward. With a toss of its big head it looked at him and half turned, putting one foot forward.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With a shock Hari recognized the swordplay position.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo had used it. Vaddo was riding this raboon.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It made perfect sense. This way the pans’ deaths would be quite natural. Vaddo could say that he was<a id="page418"></a> developing raboon riding as a new commercial application of the same hardware that worked for pan riding.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo came forward a careful step at a time, holding the long lance between two claws now. He made the end move in a circle. Movement was jerky; claws were crude, compared with pan hands. But the raboon was stronger.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It came at him with a quick feint, then a thrust. Hari barely managed to dodge sideways while he brushed the lance aside with his stick. Vaddo recovered quickly and came from Hari’s left. Jab, feint, jab, feint. Hari caught each with a swoop of his stick.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Their wooden swords smacked against each other and Hari hoped his didn’t snap. Vaddo had good control of his raboon. It did not try to flee as it had before.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was kept busy slapping aside Vaddo’s thrusts. He had to have some other advantage, or the superior strength of the raboon would eventually tell. Hari circled, drawing Vaddo away from Sheelah. The other raboons were keeping her trapped, but not attacking. All attention riveted on the two figures as they thrust and parried.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari drew Vaddo toward an outcropping. The raboon was having trouble holding its lance straight and had to keep looking down at its claws to get them right. This meant it paid less attention to where its two hooves found their footing. Hari slapped and jabbed and kept moving, making the raboon step sideways. It put a big hoof down among some angular stones, teetered, then recovered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari moved left. It stepped again and its hoof turned and it stumbled. Hari was on it in an instant. He thrust forward as the raboon looked down, feet scrambling for purchase. Hari caught the raboon full with his point.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He pushed hard. The other raboons let out a moaning sound.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Snorting in rage, the raboon tried to get off the<a id="page419"></a> point. Hari made Ipan step forward and thrust the tip farther into the raboon. The thing wailed hoarsely. Ipan plunged again. Blood spurted from it, spattering the dust. Its knees buckled and it sprawled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari shot a glance over his shoulder. The others had surged into action. Sheelah was holding off three, screeching at them so loudly it unnerved even him. She had already wounded one. Blood dripped down its brown coat.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But the others did not charge. They circled and growled and stamped their feet but came no closer. They were confused. Learning, too. He could see the quick, bright eyes studying the situation, this fresh move in the perpetual war.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sheelah stepped out and poked the nearest raboon. It launched itself at her in a snarling fit and she stuck it again, deeper. It yelped and turned—and ran.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That did it for the others. They all trotted off, leaving their fellow bleating on the ground. Its dazed eyes watched its blood trickle out. Its eyes flickered and Vaddo was gone. The animal slumped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With deliberation Hari picked up a rock and bashed in the skull. It was messy work, and he sat back inside Ipan and let the dark, smoldering pan anger come out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He bent over and studied the raboon brain. A fine silvery webbing capped the rubbery, convoluted ball. Immersion circuitry.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He turned away from the sight and only then saw that Sheelah was hurt.</span></p>
