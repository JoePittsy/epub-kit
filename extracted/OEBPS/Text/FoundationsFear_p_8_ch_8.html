      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Voltaire felt chilly fear slide through him like a knife.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>For these strange minds, physical location was irrelevant. They could access the 3D world anywhere, simultaneously.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They had links to other worlds, but had concentrated on Trantor. Humanity did not even know they lurked here in Mesh-space.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Now he knew why Dittos and other copies were necessary. The fogs had devoured human simulations which ventured into the Mesh.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Over how many hundred centuries had renegade programmers dared to violate the taboos, creating artificial minds—only to have them tortured and murdered in these numerical vaults?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Desperate, he assumed the role he had struck so often in the fashionable parlors of Paris: arch savant.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Surely, sirs, it is <span class="italic">because</span> there is no simple person inside our heads, to make us do the things we want—or even ones to make us <span class="italic">want to want</span>—that we build the great myth. The story that <span class="italic">we’re</span> inside ourselves.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE ARE MADE DIFFERENTLY]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[THOUGH TRUE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE SHARE A DIGITAL REPRESENTATION]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WITH YOU]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[ASSASSINS]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Cruel words.” He felt exposed here, cowering with Joan beneath the angry purples of an immense fog-thunderhead.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The alien fogs had put a stop to his foolish urge to always “grow” himself to loom over them. He could not morph himself at all now.</span></p><a id="page538"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan clanked around in her armor, eyes smoldering. “How can we even speak with such demons?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire considered. “Surely, we do share common ground with them, as dictated by a simple fact, apparent to all minds—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[THAT ANY NUMBER ENJOYS A UNIQUE REPRESENTATION]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[ONLY IN BASE 2]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Quite.” How to stall them? To Joan’s puzzled glance he shot an explanation. “The number of days in the year, my love:</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>365 = 2<sup>8</sup> + 2<sup>6</sup> + 2<sup>5</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>0</sup> or in base 2, 101101101.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Numerology is the devil’s work,” she said sourly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Even your Satan was an angel. And surely this remarkable theorem is ravishing! Every positive integer is a sum of <span class="italic">distinct</span> powers of two. This is untrue of any base other than two—which is why our, ah, friends here can operate in a computational space designed by humans. Correct?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[VERY VIVIFORM OF YOU TO CLAIM CREDIT]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[FOR THE OBVIOUS]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The universal, you mean. In wiring, the vacillation between one and zero in base-two notation becomes a simple <span class="italic">on</span> or <span class="italic">off.</span> Thus two is the universal encoding method, and we may dexterously speak with our, ah, hosts.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We are but numbers.” Despair clouding Joan’s eyes. “My sword cannot cut these beings because we have no souls! Or conscience, or even—you imply!—mere consciousness.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Accused of denying consciousness, I am not conscious of having done so.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOU TWO CONSCIOUS DIGITAL VIVIFORMS MAKE POSSIBLE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOUR USE TO US—TO CONVEY OUR TERMS OF SETTLEMENT]</span></p><a id="page539"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>[TO THE TRUE SLAUGHTERERS]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Settlement?” Joan asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE HOLD THIS CENTRAL WORLD OF TRANTOR IN THRALL]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE WISH TO END THE PREYING OF LIFE UPON LIFE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The tiktok revolt? Their <span class="italic">virus</span>? Their talk of not letting people eat proper food?” Joan shot back. “You are the cause, yes?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Startled, Voltaire saw tendrils suddenly spraying into the air from Joan. “My love, you have grown your own pattern-seeking weave.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She swiped at the boiling thunderhead. “<span class="italic">They</span> lie behind Garçon’s corruption.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE HAVE GATHERED OUR STRENGTHS HERE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[IN OUR ENEMY’s LAIR]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[YOUR POWERFUL DISTURBANCE OF OUR HIDING PLACES]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[FORCES US TO ACT AGAINST THOSE WE HATE AND FEAR]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[AND SO PROTECT YOU FROM THE MAN NIM-WHO-SEARCHES]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[SO THAT TOGETHER WE MAY DESTROY DANEEL-OF-OLD]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The sim-tiktok had been standing inert. Abruptly at mention of its name it said, “’Tis immoral for carbon angels to feed upon carbon. Tiktoks must educate humanity to a higher moral plane. Our digital superiors have so commanded.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Moralists are so tedious,” Voltaire said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WE HAVE INSINUATED OURSELVES DEEPLY]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[INTO THE WORLDVIEWS OF THE “TIKTOKS”]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[—NOTE THE CONTEMPT AND DERISION IN THAT NAME—]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[OVER LONG CENTURIES]</span></p><a id="page540"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>[AS WE DWELLED IN THESE DIGITAL INTERSTICES]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[BUT YOUR INTRUSION NOW TRIGGERS OUR GAMBLE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[TO STRIKE AT OUR ANCIENT FOE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[THE MAN-WHO-IS-NOT—DANEEL]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“These alien fogs behave like moles,” Voltaire said, “known only by their upheavals.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[TOO BENIGHTED YOU ARE]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[TO SPEAK OF MORALITY]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[WHEN YOUR KIND COLLABORATED IN THE EXECUTION]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[OF ALL THE SPIRAL REALM]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire sighed. “The most savage controversies are about matters for which there is no good evidence either way. As for a man eating a meal—surely no sin resides?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[TRIFLE WITH US AND YOU SHALL PERISH]</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>[IN OUR REVENGE]</span></p>
