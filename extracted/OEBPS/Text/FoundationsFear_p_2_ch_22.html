      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>“They’re…making love!” Marq exclaimed in the stands.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I know,” Sybyl said. “Isn’t it beautiful?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s a…travesty!” said the renowned Skeptic.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You are not a romantic,” Sybyl said dreamily.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Monsieur Boker said nothing. He could not avert his eyes. Before a multitude of Preservers and Skeptics, Joan was shedding her armor, Voltaire his wig, waistcoat, and velvet breeches, both in a frenzy of erotic haste.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There’s no way for us to interrupt,” Marq said. “They’re free to—ha!—debate until the allotted time is up.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Who <span class="italic">did</span> this?” Boker gasped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Everyone does this,” Marq said sardonically. “Even you.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No! <span class="italic">You</span> built this sim. <span class="italic">You</span> made them into, into—”</span></p><a id="page180"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“I stuck to philosophy,” Marq said. “Substrate personality is all in the original.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We should never have trusted!” Boker cried.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’ll never have our patronage again, either,” the Skeptic sneered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“As if it matters,” the president of Artifice Associates said sourly. “The Imperials are on their way.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Thank goodness,” Sybyl said. “Look at these people! They wanted to settle a genuine, deep issue with a public debate, then a vote. Now they’re—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Bashing each other,” Marq said. “Some renaissance.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Awful,” she said. “All our work going for—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Nothing,” the president said. He was reading his wrist comm.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No capital gains, no expansion…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The giant figures were committing intimate acts in a public place, but most in the crowd ignored them. Instead, arguments flared all around the vast coliseum.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Warrants!” the president cried. “There are Imperial warrants out for me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How nice to be wanted,” the Skeptic said.</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Kneeling before her, Voltaire murmured, “Become what I have always known you are—a woman, not a saint.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>On fire in a way she had never known before, not even in the heat of battle, she pressed his face to her bared breasts. Closed her eyes. Swayed giddily. Surrendered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A jarring disturbance at her feet made her glance down. Someone had flung Garçon ADM-213—somehow no longer in holo-space—at the screen. Had he manifested himself and the sim-cook girl he loved, in reality? But if they did not get back into sim-space at once, they’d be torn apart by the angry crowd.</span></p><a id="page181"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>She pushed Voltaire aside, reached for her sword, and ordered Voltaire to produce a horse.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, no,” Voltaire protested. “Too literal!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We must—we must—” She did not know how to deal with levels of reality. Was this a test, the crucial judgment of Purgatory?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire paused a split instant to think—though somehow she had the impression that he was marshaling resources, giving orders to unseen actors. Then the crowd froze. Went silent.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The last thing she remembered was Voltaire shouting words of encouragement to Garçon and the cook, noise, rasters flicking like bars of a prison across her vision—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then the entire coliseum—the hot-faced rioting crowd, Garçon, the cook, even Voltaire—vanished altogether. At once.</span></p>
