      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>He had a glimmering of an idea about the pans, a way to use their behaviors in building a simple toy model of psychohistory. He might be able to use the statistics of pan troop movements, the ups and downs of their shifting fortunes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Pictured in system-space, living structures worked at the edge of a chaotic terrain. Life as a whole harvested the fruits of a large menu of possible path-choices. Natural selection first achieved, then sustained this edgy state.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Whole biospheres shifted their equilibrium points amid energetic flowthrough—like birds banking on winds, he thought, watching some big yellow ones glide over the station, taking advantage of the updrafts.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Like them, whole biological systems sometimes hovered at stagnation points. Systems were able to choose several paths of descent. Sometimes—to stretch the analogy—they could eat the tasty insects<a id="page374"></a> which came up to them on those same tricky breezes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Failure to negotiate such winds of change meant the pattern forfeited its systemic integrity. Energies dissipated. Crucial was the fact that any seemingly stable state was actually a trick of dynamic feedback.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>No static state existed—except one. A biological system at perfect equilibrium was simply dead.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So, too, psychohistory?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He talked it over with Dors and she nodded. Beneath her apparent calm she was worried. Since Vaddo’s remark she was always tut-tutting about safety. He reminded her that she had earlier urged him to do more immersions. “This is a <span class="italic">vacation,</span> remember?” he said more than once.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her amused sidewise glances told him that she also didn’t buy his talk about the toy modeling. She thought he just liked romping in the woods. “A country boy at heart,” she chuckled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So the next morning he skipped a planned trek to view the gigantelope herds. Immediately he and Dors went to the immersion chambers and slipped under. To get some solid work done, he told himself.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What’s this?” He gestured to a small tiktok stationed between their immersion pods.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Precaution,” Dors said. “I don’t want anyone tampering with our chambers while we’re under.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Tiktoks cost plenty out here.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This one guards the coded locks, see?” She crouched beside the tiktok and reached for the control panel. It blocked her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I thought the locks were enough.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The security chief has access to those.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And you suspect her?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I suspect everyone. But especially her.”</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The pans slept in trees and spent plenty of time<a id="page375"></a> grooming each other. For the lucky groomer a tick or louse was a treat. With enough, they could get high on some peppery-tasting alkaloid. He suspected the careful stroking and combing of his hair by Dors was a behavior selected because it improved pan hygiene. It certainly calmed Ipan, also.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then it struck him: pans groomed rather than vocalizing. Only in crises and when agitated did they call and cry, mostly about breeding, feeding, or self-defense. They were like people who could not release themselves through the comfort of talk.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And they needed comfort. The core of their social life resembled human societies under stress—in tyrannies, in prisons, in city gangs. Nature red in tooth and claw, yet strikingly like troubled people.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But there were “civilized” behaviors here, too. Friendships, grief, sharing, buddies-in-arms who hunted and guarded turf together. Their old got wrinkled, bald, and toothless, yet were still cared for.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Their instinctive knowledge was prodigious. They knew how to make a bed of leaves as dusk fell, high up in trees. They could climb with grasping feet. They felt, cried, mourned—without being able to parse these into neat grammatical packages, so the emotions could be managed, subdued. Instead, emotions drove them.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hunger was the strongest. They found and ate leaves, fruit, insects, even fair-sized animals. They loved caterpillars.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Each moment, each small enlightenment, sank him deeper into Ipan. He began to sense the subtle nooks and crannies of the pan mind. Slowly, he gained more cooperative control.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That morning a female found a big fallen tree and began banging on it. The hollow trunk boomed like a drum and all the foraging party rushed forward to beat it, too, grinning wildly at the noise.</span></p><a id="page376"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan joined in. Hari felt the burst of joy, seethed in it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Later, coming upon a waterfall after a heavy rain, they seized vines and swung among trees, out over the foaming water, screeching with delight as they performed twists and leaps from vine to vine.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They were like children in a new playground. Hari got Ipan to make impossible moves, wild tumbles and dives, propelling him forward with abandon—to the astonishment of the other pans.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They were violent in their sudden, peevish moments—in hustling females, in working out their perpetual dominance hierarchy, and especially in hunting. A successful hunt brought enormous excitement: hugging, kissing, pats. As the troop descended to feed, the forest rang with barks, screeches, hoots, and pants. Hari joined the tumult, danced with Sheelah/Dors.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had expected to have to repress his prim meritocrat dislike of mess. Many meritocrats even disliked soil itself. Not Hari, who had been reared among farmers and laborers. Still, he had thought that long exposure to Trantor’s prissy aesthetics would hamper him here. Instead, the pans’ filth seemed natural.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In some matters he did have to restrain his feelings. Rats the pans ate headfirst. Larger game they smashed against rocks. They devoured the brains first, a steaming delicacy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari gulped—metaphorically, but with Ipan echoing the impulse—and watched, screening his reluctance. Ipan had to eat, after all.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>At the scent of predators, he felt Ipan’s hair stand on end. Another tangy bouquet made Ipan’s mouth water. He gave no mercy to food, even if it was still walking. Evolution in action; those pans who had showed mercy in the past ate less and left fewer descendants. Those weren’t represented here anymore.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>For all its excesses, he found the pans’ behavior hauntingly familiar. Males gathered often for combat,<a id="page377"></a> for pitching rocks, for blood sports, to work out their hierarchy. Females networked and formed alliances. There were trades of favors for loyalty, kinship bonds, turf wars, threats and displays, protection rackets, a hunger for “respect,” scheming subordinates, revenge—a social world enjoyed by many people that history had judged “great.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Much like the Emperor’s court, in fact.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Did people long to strip away their clothing and conventions, bursting forth as pans? A brainy pan would be quite at home in the Imperial gentry…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari felt a flush of revulsion so strong Ipan shook and fidgeted. Humanity’s lot <span class="italic">had</span> to be different, not this primitive horror.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could use this, certainly, as a test bed for a full theory. <span class="italic">Then</span> humankind would be self-knowing, captains of themselves. He would build in the imperatives of the pans, but go far beyond—to true, deep psychohistory.</span></p>
