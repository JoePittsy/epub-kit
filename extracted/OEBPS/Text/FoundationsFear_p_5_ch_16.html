      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>They used pan modes of patrolling.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He and Dors let their basic levels take over, portions of the brain expert at silent movement, careful of every twig.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Once they had left the humans behind, the pans grew even more cautious. They had few natural enemies, but the faint scent of a single predator changed the feel of the wild.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan climbed tall trees and sat for hours surveying the open land ahead before venturing forth. He weighed the evidence of pungent droppings, faint prints, bent branches.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They angled down the long slope of the valley and stayed in the forest. Hari had only glanced at the big color-coded map of the area all guests received and had trouble recalling much of it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Finally he recognized one of the distant, beak-shaped peaks. Hari got his bearings. Dors spotted a stream snaking down into the main river and that gave them further help, but still they did not<a id="page401"></a> know which way lay the Excursion Station. Or how far.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">That way?</span> Hari signed, pointing over the distant ridge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">No. That,</span> Dors insisted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Far, not.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Why?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The worst part of it all was that they could not talk. He could not say clearly that the technology of immersion worked best at reasonably short range, less than a hundred klicks, say. And it made sense to keep the subject pans within easy flyer distance. Certainly Vaddo and the others had gotten to the troop quickly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Is,</span> he persisted.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Not.</span> She pointed down the valley. <span class="italic">Maybe there.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could only hope Dors got the general idea. Their signs were scanty and he began to feel a broad, rising irritation. Pans felt and sensed strongly, but they were so <span class="italic">limited.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan expressed this by tossing limbs and stones, banging on tree trunks. It didn’t help much. The need to speak was like a pressure he could not relieve. Dors felt it, too. Sheelah chippered and grunted in frustration.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Beneath his mind he felt the smoldering presence of Ipan. They had never been together this long before and urgency welled up between the two canted systems of mind. Their uneasy marriage was showing greater strains.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Sit. Quiet.</span> She did. He cupped a hand to his ear.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Bad come?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">No. Listen</span>—In frustration Hari pointed to Sheelah herself. Blank incomprehension in the pan’s face. He scribbled in the dust: <small>LEARN FROM PANS.</small> Sheelah’s mouth opened and she nodded.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They squatted in the shelter of prickly bushes and<a id="page402"></a> listened to the sounds of the forest. Scurryings and murmurs came through strongly as Hari relaxed his grip on the pan. Dust hung in slanted cathedral light, pouring down from the forest canopy in rich yellow shafts. Scents purled up from the forest floor, chemical messengers telling Ipan of potential foods, soft loam for resting, bark to be chewed. Hari gently lifted Ipan’s head to gaze across the valley at the peaks…musing…and felt a faint tremor of resonance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To Ipan the valley came weighted with significance beyond words. His troop had imbued it with blunt emotions, attached to clefts where a friend fell and died, where the troop found a hoard of fruits, where they met and fought two big cats. It was an intricate landscape suffused with feeling, the pan mechanism of memory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari faintly urged Ipan to think beyond the ridge line and felt in response a diffuse anxiety. He bore in on that kernel—and an image burst into Ipan’s mind, fringed in fear. A rectangular bulk framed against a cool sky. The Excursion Station.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">There.</span> He pointed for Dors.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ipan had simple, strong, apprehensive memories of the place. His troop had been taken there, outfitted with the implants which allowed them to be ridden, then deposited back in their territory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">Far,</span> Dors signed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">We go.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Hard. Slow.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">No stay here. They catch.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors looked as skeptical as a pan could look. <span class="italic">Fight?</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Did she mean fight Vaddo here? Or fight once they reached the Excursion Station? <span class="italic">No here. There.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors frowned, but accepted this. He had no real plan, only the idea that Vaddo was ready for pans out here and might not be so prepared for them at the station. There he and Dors might gain the element of<a id="page403"></a> surprise. How, he had no idea.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>They studied each other, each trying to catch a glimmer of the other in an alien face. She stroked his earlobe, Dors’ calming gesture. Sure enough, it made him tingle. But he could say so little…. The moment crystallized for him the hopelessness of their situation.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Vaddo plainly was trying to kill Hari and Dors through Ipan and Sheelah. What would become of their own bodies? The shock of experiencing death through immersion was known to prove fatal. Their bodies would fail from neurological shock, without ever regaining consciousness.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He saw a tear run down Sheelah’s cheek. She knew how hopeless matters were, too. He swept her up in his arms and, looking at the distant mountains, was surprised to find tears in his own eyes as well.</span></p>
