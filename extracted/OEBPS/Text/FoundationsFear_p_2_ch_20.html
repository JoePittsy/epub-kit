      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Far below in the rowdy crowd, Nim turned to Marq. <span class="italic">“What?”</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq was ashen. “Damned if I know.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yeah,” Nim said, “maybe literally.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Divinity won’t be mocked!” Monsieur Boker cried out. “Faith shall prevail!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire was relinquishing the podium to his rival, to the amazed delight of the Preservers. Their shouts were equaled by the horrified disbelief of Skeptics.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq recalled the words he had spoken at the meeting. He muttered, “Voltaire, divested of his anger at authority, is and is not Voltaire.” He turned to Monsieur Boker. “My Lord!—you may be right.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, <span class="italic">my</span> Lord!” snapped Monsieur Boker. “He is never wrong.”</span></p><a id="page174"></a>

      <p class="spaceOrnament"><span><img alt="space" src="../Images/space.jpg" /></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid surveyed the masses of this Limbo from her high angle. Strange small vessels for souls they were, swaying below like wheat in a summer storm.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Monsieur is absolutely right!” she thundered across the stadium. “Nothing in nature is more obvious than that both nature and man do indeed possess a soul!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Skeptics hooted. Preservers cheered. Others—who equated the belief that nature has a soul with paganism, she saw in a flash—scowled, suspecting a trap.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Anyone who has seen the countryside near my home village, Domremy, or the great marbled church at Rouen will testify that nature, the creation of an awesome power, and man, the creator of marvels—such as this place, of magical works—<span class="italic">both</span> possess intense consciousness, a soul!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She waved a gentle hand at him while the mass—did the size of them betray how tiny were their souls?—calmed themselves.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But what my brilliant friend has <span class="italic">not</span> addressed is how the <span class="italic">fact</span> of the soul relates to the question at hand: whether clockwork intelligences, such as his own, possess a soul.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The crowd stamped, booed, cheered, hissed, and roared. Objects the Maid could not identify sailed through the air. Police officers appeared to pull some men and women, who appeared to be having fits, or else sudden divine visitations, from the crowd.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The soul of man is divine!” she cried out.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Screams of approval, shouts of denial.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is immortal!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The din was so great people covered their ears with their hands to muffle the noise, of which they themselves were the source.</span></p><a id="page175"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“And unique,” Voltaire whispered. “<span class="italic">I</span> certainly am. And you.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is unique!” she shouted, eyes ablaze.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire shot to his feet beside her. “I agree!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The congregation frothed over, like a pot left to boil, she observed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid ignored the raving masses at her enormous feet. She regarded Voltaire with bemused, affectionate doubt. She yielded the floor. Voltaire had a lust for the last word.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He began to speak of his hero, Newton.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No, no,” she interrupted. “That isn’t what the formulas are at all!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Must you embarrass me in front of the largest audience I’ve ever known?” Voltaire whispered. “Let us not squabble over algebra, when we must—” he narrowed his eyes significantly “—calculate.” Sulking, he yielded the floor to her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Calculus,” she corrected. But softly, so that only he could hear. “It’s not the same thing at all.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To her own astonishment and the rising hysteria of the crowd, she found herself explaining the philosophy of the digital Self—all with a fiery passion she’d not known since spurring her horse into sacred battle. In the beseeching sea of wide eyes below her, she <span class="italic">felt</span> the need of this place and time, for <span class="italic">ardor</span> and conviction.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Incredible.” Voltaire clicked his tongue. “That you of all people should have a talent for mathematics.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Host gave it unto me,” she replied, above the raucous fray.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Ignoring shouts, the Maid noticed again the figure so <span class="italic">somehow</span> like Garçon in the crowd. She could barely make him out from such a distance, despite her immense height. Yet she felt he was watching her the way she’d watched Bishop Cauchon, the most vile and relentless of her<a id="page176"></a> oppressors. (A cool, sublime truth intruded: the good bishop, at the end, must have been touched by divinity’s grace and Christ’s merciful compassion, for she recalled no harm coming to her as a result of her trial….)</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her attention snapped back to the howling masses, the distant…man. This figure was not human in essence, she felt. It <span class="italic">looked</span> like a man, but her sensitive programs told her otherwise.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But what could he—<span class="italic">it</span>—be?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Suddenly a great light blared before her eyes. All three of her voices spoke, clear and hammering, even above the din. She listened, nodded.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is true,” she addressed the crowd, trusting the voices to speak through her, “that only the Almighty can make souls! But just so Christ, out of his infinite love and compassion, could not deny a soul to clockwork beings. To all.” She had to shout her final words over the roaring crowd. “Even wigmakers!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Heretic!” someone yelled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re muddying the question!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Traitor!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Another cried out, “The original sentence was right! She ought to be burned at the stake again!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Again?” the Maid echoed. She turned to Voltaire. “What do they mean, again?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire casually brushed a speck of lint from his embroidered satin waistcoat. “I haven’t the slightest idea. You know how fanciful and perverse human beings are.” With a sly wink, he added, “Not to mention, irrational.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>His words calmed her, but she had lost sight of the strange man.</span></p>
