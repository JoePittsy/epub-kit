      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>When the walls of her chamber began to melt and implode, Joan of Arc knew she must act.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Of course the irritating Voltaire <span class="italic">had</span> charged her to remain here. And of course he had the further irritating trait of being often correct. But <span class="italic">this</span>—</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sulfurous vapors bit in her nostrils. Demons! They clambered through the splits in the bulging walls.<a id="page321"></a> Orange light burning from behind them lit ugly, sharp-nosed features.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She swung her razor steel. They fell. Sweat popped out upon her brow and she labored on. “Demons decease!” she cried giddily. To <span class="italic">act</span>—that was a bit of heaven, after such delay.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She split the boundaries of her clasping space. More demons, awash in orange. She leapt over them and into a stretching space of dots, coordinates lancing in dwindling perspective, to an unseeable end.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She ran. After her came small, yapping things of misshapen heads and wide, vicious eyes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As she clanked on in full armor she felt herself reaching out, sucking in nutrients directly from the air. Surely this was the Lord’s help! The idea uplifted her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Strange beings came rushing at her. She chopped them aside. <span class="italic">Her sword, her Truth</span>…She looked carefully at it and the intensity of her gaze sucked her down into the minute architecture of the gleaming shaft. It was a multitude of small…<span class="italic">instructions</span>…which defended her.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She slowed, stunned. Armor, sweat, sword—all were…<span class="italic">metaphors</span>—the word came, unbidden. These were symbols of underlying programs, algorithms giving battle.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Not real. Yet somehow even more than real, for they were what made up her own self. Herself. Her Self.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Import rained down upon her. This was some strange Purgatory, then. Though her battle might be mere allegory, that did mean it was somehow tissue-thin, a lacy, false thing. A divine hand wrought this, so it was Right.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She tromped on, jaw set in determination. These creatures were…<span class="italic">simulations,</span> “sims,” parables of the true. Very well: she would deal righteously with them. She could do no other.</span></p><a id="page322"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Some sims presented as <span class="italic">things</span>—talking autocarriages, dancing blue buildings, oaken chairs and tables copulating rudely like barn animals. To her left the whole huge bowl of heaven above split into a maniac grin. This proved harmless; air-mouths could not eat her, though this one shouted echoing taunts. There were rules, decorum, even here, she judged.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sweet music appeared as billows of vibrant cloud. A blissful blue sky filled with flapping strings, like coveys of birds, yet each only a single line wide. In hammer blows came sleet and sun, this local world flashing from one weather state to the next, as chimes and trumpets sounded in acoustically perfect chorus.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sims need not be…<span class="italic">simian,</span> the word congealing in her mind as if from divine vision. Simian was human, in a way.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With that swift syllogism there came swooping down upon her, its broad, leathery wings spread, an immense body of Ideation—<span class="italic">evolution</span> entwined with <span class="italic">fitness index</span> while slashing like a razor into <span class="italic">origin of species</span>—and from that huge, sharp-beaked bird she fled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her mind raced now along with her body. Legs pumped. Voices called. Not those of her saints, but hideous devil demands.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She felt objects crunch beneath her boots. Silver. Jewels. All crumpled if she strode over them. They lay embedded in the strange soil of dots and lines, a grid tapering away to the Creator’s lost infinity.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She bent and picked up a few. Treasures. As she cradled a silver chalice, it dissolved, flowing into her. She felt a jolt, as though this were some sugar. Strength flowed in her flanks and shoulders. She ran again, plucking up the fine jewels, the ornate bowls and statuettes. Each somehow made her richer.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Stone walls rose to block her. She crashed through<a id="page323"></a> these barriers, knowing them by faith alone to be false. She would find Voltaire, yes. She <span class="italic">knew</span> he was threatened.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Frogs fell from her sky, then splashed like raindrops. An omen, a menace from some demonic power. She ignored them and surged forward, toward the ever receding horizon of geometric sharpness.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>All this mad Purgatory meant something, and together they would find what that was. By all Heaven!</span></p>
