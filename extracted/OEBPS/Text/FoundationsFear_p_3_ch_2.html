      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Not quite time for the Specials to arrive, Hari thought. But getting any work done was impossible while he was on edge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He jiggled coins in his pocket, distracted, then fished one out. A five cred piece, amber alloy, a handsome Cleon I head on one side—treasuries always flattered emperors—and the disk of the Galaxy seen from above on the other. He held it on edge and thought.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Let the coin’s width represent the disk’s typical scale height. To be correct, the coin would have to bulge at its center to depict the hub, but overall it was a good geometric replica.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In the disk was a flaw, a minute blister in an outer spiral arm. He did the ratio in his head, allowing that the galaxy was about 100,000 light-years across, and…blinked. The speck portrayed a volume about a thousand light years across. In the outer arms, that would contain ten million stars.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To see so many worlds as a fleck adrift in immensity made him feel as though Trantor’s solidity had opened and he had plunged helplessly into an abyss.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Could humanity matter on such a scale? So many billions of souls, packed into a grainy dot.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yet they had spanned the whole incomprehensible expanse of that disk in a twinkling.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Humanity had spread through the spiral arms,<a id="page211"></a> spilling through the wormholes, wrapping itself around the hub in a mere few thousand years. In that time the spiral arms themselves had not revolved a perceptible angle in their own gravid gavotte; that would take half a billion years. Human hankering for far horizons had sent them swarming through the wormhole webbing, popping out into spaces near suns of swelling red, virulent blue, smoldering ruby.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The speck stood for a volume a single human brain, with its primate capacities, could not grasp, except as mathematical notation. But that same brain led humans outward, until they now strode the Galaxy, mastering the starlit abyss…without truly knowing themselves.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So a <span class="italic">single</span> human could not fathom even a dot in the disk. But the sum of humanity could, incrementally, one mind at a time, knowing its own immediate starry territory.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And what did he desire? To comprehend all of that humanity, its deepest impulses, its shadowy mechanisms, its past, present, and future. He wanted to <span class="italic">know</span> the vagrant species that had managed to scoop up this disk, and to make it a plaything.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So maybe one single human mind could indeed grasp the disk, by going one level higher—and fathoming the collective effects, hidden in the intricacies of the Equations.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Describing Trantor, in <span class="italic">this</span> proportion, was child’s play. For the Empire, he needed a far grander comprehension.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Mathematics might rule the galaxy. Invisible, gossamer symbols could govern.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So a single man or woman could a matter.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Maybe. He shook his head. A single human head.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span class="italic">Getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren’t we? Dreams of godhood…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Back to work.</span></p><a id="page212"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Only he couldn’t work. He had to wait. To his relief, the Imperial Specials arrived and escorted him across Streeling University. By now he was used to the gawkers, the embarrassment of plowing through the crowds which now accumulated everywhere, it seemed, that he might frequent.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Busy today,” he said to the Specials captain.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Got to expect it, sir.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You get extra duty pay for this, I hope.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yessir. ‘Digs,’ we call them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For extra risk, correct? Dangerous duty.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The captain looked flustered. “Well, yessir…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“If someone starts shooting, what are your orders?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Uh, if they can penetrate the engaging perimeter, we’re to get between them and you. Sir.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And you’d do that? Take a gauss pulse or a flechette?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He seemed surprised. “Of course.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Truly?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Our duty, y’know.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was humbled by the man’s simple loyalty. Not to Hari Seldon, but to the idea of Empire. Order. Civilization.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And Hari realized that he, too, was devoted to that idea. The Empire had to be saved, or at least its decline mitigated. Only by fathoming its deep structure could he do that.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Which was why he disliked the First Minister business. It robbed him of time, concentration.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In the Specials’ armored pods he salved his discontent by pulling out his tablet and working on some equations. The captain had to remind him when they reached the palace grounds. Hari got out and there was the usual security ritual, the Specials spreading out and airborne sensors going aloft to sniff out the far perimeter. They reminded him of golden bees, buzzing with vigilance.</span></p><a id="page213"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>He walked by a wall leading into the palace gardens and a tan, round sheet the size of his fingernail popped off the wall. It stuck to his neck. He reached up and plucked it off.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He recognized it as a promotional trinket, a slap-on patch which gave you a pleasant rush by diffusing endorphins into your bloodstream. It also subtly predisposed you to coherent signals in corridor advertisements.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He pitched it aside. A Special grabbed at the patch and suddenly there was shouting and movement all around him. The Special turned to throw the patch away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>An orange spike shot through the guard’s hand, hissing hot, flaring and gone in a second. The man cried, “Ah!” and another Special grabbed him and pushed him down. Then five Specials blocked Hari from all sides and he saw no more.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Special screamed horribly. Something cut off the wail of pain. The captain shouted, “Move!” and Hari had to trot with the Specials around him into the gardens and down several lanes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It took a while to straighten out the incident. The patch was untraceable, of course, and there was no way of knowing for sure whether it was targeted on Hari at all.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Could be part of some Palace plot,” the captain said. “Just waiting for the next passerby with a scent-signature like yours.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not aimed for me at all?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Could be. That tab took couple extra seconds tryin’ to figure out if it wanted you or not.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And it did.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Body odor, skin smells—they’re not exact, sir.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’ll have to start wearing perfume.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The captain grinned. “That won’t stop a smart tab.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Other protection specialists rushed in and there<a id="page214"></a> was evidence to measure and opinions and a lot of talk. Hari insisted on walking back to see the Special who had taken the tab. He was gone, already off to emergency care; they said he would lose his hand. No, sorry, Hari could not see him. Security, y’know.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Quite quickly Hari became bored with the aftermath. He had come early to get a stroll through the gardens and though he knew he was being irrational, his regret at missing the walk loomed larger than the assassination attempt.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari took a long, still moment and moved the incident aside. He visualized a displacement operator, an icy blue vector frame. It listed the snarled, angry red knot and pushed it out of view. Later, he would deal with it later.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He cut off the endless talk and ordered the Specials to fall in behind him. Shouted protests came, of course, which he ignored. Then he ambled across the gardens, relishing the open air. He inhaled eagerly. The blinding speed of the attack had erased its importance to him. For now.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The palace towers loomed like webwork of a giant spider. Between their bulks weaved airy walkways. Spires were veiled in silvery mist and aripple, apulse, shimmering with a silent, steady beat like a great unseen heart. He had been so long in the foreshortened views of Trantor’s corridors, his eyes did not quickly grasp the puzzling perspectives.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>An upward rush caught his attention as he passed through a flowerscape. From the immense Imperial aviary, flocks of birds in the thousands oscillated in the vertical drafts. Their artful, ever-shifting patterns had a diaphanous, billowy quality, an immense, wispy dance.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Yet these had been shaped many millennia ago by bioengineering their genome. They formed drifts and billows like clouds, or even airy mountains, feasting<a id="page215"></a> on upwelling gnats, released from below by the gardeners. But a side draft could dissolve all their ornate sculptures, blow them away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Like the Empire, he mused. Beautiful in its order, stable for fifteen millennia, yet now toppling. Cracking up like a slow-motion pod wreck. Or in spasms like the Junin riots.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Why? Even among Imperial loveliness, his mathist mind returned to the problem.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Entering the palace, he passed a delegation of children on their way to some audience with a lesser Imperial figure. With a sudden pang he missed his adopted son, Raych. He and Dors had decided to secretly send the boy away to school, after Yugo had his leg broken. “Deprive them of targets,” Dors had said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Among the meritocracy, only those adults with commitment, stability, and talent could have children. Gentry or plain citizens could whelp brats by the shovelful.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Parents were like artists—special people with a special gift, given respect and privileges, left free to create happy and competent humans. It was noble work, well paid. Hari had been honored to be approved.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In immediate contrast, three oddly shaped courtiers ambled by him.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>By biotech means people could turn their children into spindly towers, into flowerlike footbound dwarves, into green giants or pink pygmies. From throughout the Galaxy they were sent here to amuse the Imperial court, where novelty was always in vogue.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But such variants seldom lasted. There was a species norm. And stretching it was just as deeply ingrained. Hari had to admit that he would forever be among the unsophisticated, for he found such folk repulsive.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Someone had designed the reception room to look like anything but a room for receiving people. It<a id="page216"></a> resembled a lumpy pocket in molten glass, crisscrossed by polished shafts of ceramo-steel. These shafts in turn dripped into smooth lumps which—since there was nothing else in the room—must have been intended to be chairs and tables.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>It seemed unlikely that he could ever get back out of any of the shapes, once he had worked out how to sit in them—so Hari stood. And wondered if that effect, too, was somehow intended…The palace was a subtle place of layered design.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>This was to be a small, private meeting, Cleon’s staff had assured him. Still, there was a small army of attachès and protocol officers and aides who had introduced themselves as Hari had passed through several rooms of increasing ornamentation, on his way here. Their talk became more ornate, as well. Courtly life was dominated by puffed-up people who always acted as though they were coyly unveiling statues of themselves.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>There was a lot of adornment and finery, the architectural equivalent of jewels and silk, and even the most minor attendants wore very dignified green uniforms. He felt as though he should lower his voice and realized, recalling Sundays on Helicon, that this place felt somehow like a church.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Then Cleon swept in and the staff vanished, silently draining away into concealed exits.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My Seldon!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yours, sire.” Hari followed the ritual.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Emperor continued greeting him effusively, tut-tutting over the apparent assassination attempt—“Surely an accident, don’t you think?”—and led him to the large display wall. At Cleon’s gesture an enormous view of the entire Galaxy appeared, the work of a new artist. Hari murmured the required admiration and recalled his thoughts of only an hour before.</span></p><a id="page217"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>This was a time sculpture, tracing the entire Galactic history. The disk was, after all, a collection of debris, swirling at the bottom of a gravitational pothole in the cosmos. How it looked depended on which of mankind’s myriad eyes one used. Infrared could pierce and unmask dusty lanes. X rays sought pools of fiercely burning gas. Radio dishes mapped cold banks of molecules and magnetized plasma. All were packed with meaning.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In the carousel of the disk, stars bobbed and weaved under complicated Newtonian tugs. The major arms—Sagittarius, Orion, and Perseus, counting outward from the Center—bore names obscured by antiquity. Each contained a Zone of that name, hinting that perhaps here the ancient Earth orbited. But no one knew, and research had revealed no obvious single candidate. Instead, dozens of worlds vied for the title of the True Earth. Quite probably, none of them were.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Many bright signatures—skymarks, like landmarks?—blazed among the curving, barred spiral arms. Beauty beyond description—but not beyond analysis, Hari thought, whether physical or social. If he could find the key…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I congratulate you on the success of my Moron Decree,” Cleon said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari slowly withdrew from the immense perspective. “Uh, sire?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Your idea—first fruit of psychohistory.” To Hari’s blank incomprehension Cleon chuckled. “Forgotten already? The renegades who pillage, seeking renown for their infamy. You advised me to strip them of their identity by making them henceforth be called Morons.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had indeed forgotten the advice, but contented himself with a sage nod.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It worked! Such crimes are much reduced. And<a id="page218"></a> those convicted go to their deaths full of anger, demanding to be made famous. I tell you, it is delicious.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari felt a chill at the way the Emperor smacked his lips. An off-hand suggestion made suddenly, concretely real. It rattled him a bit.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He realized that the Emperor was asking about progress with psychohistory. His throat tightened and he remembered the Moonrose woman with her irritating questions. That seemed weeks ago. “Work is slow,” he managed to say.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon said sympathetically, “Surely it requires a deep knowledge of every facet of civilized life.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“At times.” Hari stalled, putting his mixed emotions firmly away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I was at a convocation recently and learned something you undoubtedly have factored into your equations.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, sire?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is said that the very foundation of the Empire—besides the wormholes of course—is the discovery of proton-Boron fusion. I had never heard of it, yet the speaker said it was the single greatest achievement of antiquity. That every starship, every planetary technology, depends upon it for power.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I suppose that is true, but I did not know it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Such an elementary fact?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“What is not of use to me does not concern me.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon’s mouth pouted in puzzlement. “But a theory of all history surely demands great detail.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Technology enters only in its effects on other large issues,” Hari said. How to explain the intricacies of nonlinear calculus? “Often its limitations are the important point.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced,” Cleon said airily.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well put, sire.”</span></p><a id="page219"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“You like it? That fellow Draius gave it to me. It has a ring, doesn’t it? True, too. Perhaps I’ll—” He broke off and said to the air, “Transcription officer! Give that line about magic to the Presepth for general distribution.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon sat back. “They’re always after me for ‘Imperial wisdom.’ A bother!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A faint musical note announced Betan Lamurk. Hari stiffened at first sight of the man, but Lamurk had eyes only for the Emperor as he went smoothly through a litany of court ritual. As a prime member of the High Council he had to recite some time-honored and empty phrases, bow with a curious swoop, and never avert his gaze from the Emperor. That done, he could relax.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Professor Seldon! So good to meet again.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari shook hands in the formal manner. “Sorry about that little dustup. I really didn’t know the 3D was there.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No matter. One can’t help what the media make of things.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My Seldon gave me excellent advice about the Moron Decree,” Cleon said. He went on, his delight deepening the twist of Lamurk’s mouth.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon led them to luxuriant chairs that popped out of the walls. Hari found himself swept immediately into a detailed discussion of Council matters. Resolutions, measures of appropriation, abstracts of proposed legislation. This stuff had been flowing through Hari’s office, as well. He had dutifully set his autosec to text-analyzing it, breaking the sea of jargon down into Galactic and smoothing out the connections. This got him through the first hour. Most of the material he had ignored, tipping piles of to-be-scanned documents into his recycler when nobody was looking.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The arcane workings of the High Council were not<a id="page220"></a> in principle difficult to follow—they were just boring. As Lamurk deftly conferred with the Emperor, Hari watched them as he would watch a bodyball game: a curious practice, no doubt fascinating in a narrow sort of way.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That the Council set general standards and directions, while below them mere legal mavens worked out the details and passed legislation, did not change his bemused disinterest. People spent their <span class="italic">lives</span> doing such things!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>For tactics he cared little. Even mankind did not matter. On the Galactic chessboard the pieces were the phenomena of humanity, the rules of the game were the laws of psychohistory. The player on the other side was hidden, perhaps did not exist.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lamurk needed an opposite player, a rival. Subtly, Hari saw that he was the inevitable foe.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lamurk’s career had aimed him for the First Ministership and he meant to get it. At every turn Lamurk curried favor with the Emperor and waved away Hari’s points, of which there were few.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He did not directly counter Lamurk; the man was a master. He kept quiet, confining himself to an occasional expressively (he hoped) raised eyebrow. He had rarely regretted keeping quiet.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“This MacroMesh thing, do you favor it?” the Emperor abruptly asked Hari.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He barely remembered the idea. “It will alter the Galaxy considerably,” he stalled.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Productively!” Lamurk slapped a table. “All the econ-indicators are falling. The MacroMesh will speed up info-flow, boost productivity.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Emperor’s mouth tilted with doubt. “I’m not altogether happy with the idea of linking so many, so easily.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Just think,” Lamurk pressed, “the new squeezers<a id="page221"></a> will let an ordinary person in, say, Eqquis Zone talk every day with a friend in the Far Reaches—or anywhere else.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Emperor nodded uncertainly. “Hari? What do you think?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I have doubts as well.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lamurk waved dismissively. “Failure of nerve.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Increased communication may worsen the Empire’s crisis.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lamurk’s mouth twisted derisively. “Nonsense. Contrary to every good executive rule.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The Empire isn’t ruled—” Hari made a half-bow to the Emperor “—alas, it’s <span class="italic">let</span> run.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“More nonsense. We in the High Council—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Hear him out!” Cleon said. “He does not talk very much.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari smiled. “Many people are grateful for that, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“No oblique answers, now. What does your psychohistory tell you about how the Empire runs?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is millions of castles, webbed by bridges.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Castles?” Cleon’s famous nose rose skeptically.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Planets. They have local concerns and run themselves as they like. The Empire doesn’t trouble itself over such details, unless a world begins making aggressive trouble.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“True enough, and as it should be,” Cleon said. “Ah—and your bridges are the wormholes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Exactly, sire.” Hari deliberately avoided looking at Lamurk and focused on the Emperor, while sketching in his vision.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Planets could have any number of lesser duchies, with disputes and wars and “microstructure” galore. The psychohistorical equations showed that none of that mattered.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>What did matter was that physical resources could not be shared among indefinitely large numbers of people. Each solar system was a finite store of goods,<a id="page222"></a> and in the end, that meant local hierarchies to control access.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Wormholes could carry rather little mass, because the holes were seldom more than ten meters across. Massive hyperspace ships carried heavy cargoes, but they were slower and cumbersome. They distorted space-time, contracting it fore and expanding it aft, moving at super-light speeds in the Galaxy’s frame but not in its own. Trade among most stellar systems was constrained to light, compact, expensive items. Spices, fashions, technology—not bulky raw materials.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Wormholes could accommodate modulated light beams far more easily. The wormhole curvature refracted beams through to receivers at the other mouth. Data flowed freely, knitting together the Galaxy.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>And information was the opposite of mass. Data could be moved, compressed, and leaked readily through copies. It was infinitely shareable. It blossomed like flowers in eternal spring, for as information was applied to a problem, the resulting solution was new information. And it was cheap, meaning that it took few mass resources to acquire it. Its preferred medium was light, quite literally—the laser beam.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That provided enough communication to make an Empire. But the odds of a native of the Puissant Zone ever voyaging to the Zaqulot Zone—or even to the next star, since by wormhole they are equivalent trips—were tiny,” Hari said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So every one of your ‘castles’ kept itself isolated—except for information flow,” Cleon said, absorbed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But now the MacroMesh will increase the information transfer rate a thousand-fold, using these ‘squeezers’ that compress information.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon pursed his lips, puzzled. “Why is that bad?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It’s not,” Lamurk said. “Better data makes for better decisions, everybody knows that.”</span></p><a id="page223"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Not necessarily. Human life is a voyage on a sea of meaning, not a net of information. What will most people get from a close, personal flow of data? Detached, foreign logic. Uprooted details.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We can run things better!” Lamurk insisted. Cleon held up a finger and Lamurk choked off his next words.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari hesitated. Lamurk had a point, indeed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>There were mathematical relationships between technology, capital accumulation, labor, but the most important driver proved to be knowledge. About half the Empire’s economic growth came from the increase in the quality of information, as embodied in better machines and improved skills, leading to efficiency.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That was where the Empire had faltered. The innovative thrust of the sciences had slowly faltered. The Imperial universities produced fine engineers, but no inventors. Great scholars, but few true scientists. That factored into the other tides of time. But something other than data starvation had made that happen, and as yet, Hari did not know the cause.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But Hari saw the Emperor wavering, and pressed on. “Many on the High Council see the MacroMesh as an instrument of control. Let me point out a few facts well known to you, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was in his favorite mode, a one-on-one lecture. Cleon leaned forward, eyes narrowed. Hari spun him a tale.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To get between worlds A and B, he said, one might have to take a dozen wormhole jumps—the Worm Nest was an astrophysical subway system with many transfers.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Each worm mouth imposed added fees and charges on every shipment. Control of an entire trade route yielded the maximum profit. The<a id="page224"></a> struggle for control was unending, often violent. From the viewpoint of economics, politics, and “historical momentum”—which meant a sort of imposed inertia on events—a local empire which controlled a whole constellation of nodes should be solid, enduring.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Not so. Time and again, regional satrapies went toes-up. It seemed natural to squeeze every worm passage for the maximum fee, by coordinating every worm mouth to optimize traffic. But that degree of control made people restive. In elaborately controlling the system, information flowed only from managers to wage slaves, with little feedback.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Extensive regulation did not deliver the best benefits. Instead, it yielded “short blanket economies”—when the collective shoulders got cold, the blanket got pulled up to cover them, and so the feet froze. Over-control failed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“So the MacroMesh, if it lets the High Council really ‘run things,’ could decrease economic vitality.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lamurk smiled patronizingly. “A bunch of abstract theory, sire. Now, you listen to an old hand who’s been on the Council a good long time now…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari attended to Lamurk’s famous balm and wondered why he was bothering with this. He had to admit that trading ideas with the Emperor had a certain quality of casual, almost sensual, power. Watching a man who could destroy a world with a gesture had a decided adrenaline edge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But he didn’t really belong here, either by talent or drive. Trotting out his own views was amusing; every professor secretly thinks that what the world needs is a good, solid lecture—from him, of course.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But in this game, the pawns were real. The Moron Decree had unnerved him, even though he saw nothing morally wrong with it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Lives hung in the balance here, among the finery.<a id="page225"></a> And not just the lives of others. He had to remind himself that this beaming, confident Lamurk across from him was the obvious source of the patch-weapon which had nearly killed him, just hours before.</span></p>
