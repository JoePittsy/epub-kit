      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Hari sat alone and stared at the holo of a raging, ancient prairie fire.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In its place now stood the Empire. He knew now that he loved the Empire for reasons he could not name. The dark revelation, that the robots had visited death and destruction upon the old, remnant digital minds…even that did not deter him. He would never know the details of that ancient crime—he hoped.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To preserve his sanity, for the first time in his life he <span class="italic">did not want</span> to know.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Empire that stood all around him was even more marvelous than he had suspected. And more sobering.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Who could accept that humanity did not control its own future—that history was the result of forces acting beyond the horizons of mere mortal men? The Empire had endured because of its metanature, not the valiant acts of individuals, or even of worlds.</span></p><a id="page573"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Many would argue for human self-determination. Their arguments were not wrong or even ineffectual—just beside the point. As persuasion they were powerful. Everyone wanted to believe they were masters of their own fate. Logic had nothing to do with it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Even Emperors were nothing; chaff blown by winds they could not see.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As if to refute him, Cleon’s image abruptly coagulated in the holo. “Hari! Where have you been?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Working.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“On your equations, I hope—because you’re going to need them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sire?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The High Council just met in special session. I appeared; a note of grace and gravity was much needed. In the wake of the, ah, tragic loss of Lamurk and his, ah, associates, I urged the quick election of a First Minister.” A broad wink. “For stability, you understand.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari croaked, “Oh no.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh, yes!—my First Minister.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But wasn’t there—didn’t anyone suspect—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You? A harmless academic, bringing off assassinations in dozens of places, all over Trantor? Using tiktoks?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Well, you know how people will talk—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon gave him a shrewd look. “Come now, Hari…how <span class="italic">did</span> you do it?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I count among my allies a gang of renegade robots.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon laughed loudly, slapping his desk. “I never knew you were such a jokester. Very well, I quite understand. You should not be forced to reveal your sources.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari had sworn to himself that he would never lie to the Emperor. Not being believed was not part of the agreement. “I assure you, sire—”</span></p><a id="page574"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Of course you are right to jest. I am not naïve.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“And I am a lousy liar, sire.” True also, and as well, the best way to close the matter.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I want you to come to the formal reception for the High Council. Now that you’re First Minister, there will be these social matters. But before that, I do want you to think about the Sark situation and—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I can advise you now.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon brightened. “Oh?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There are dampers in history, sire, which stabilize the Empire. The New Renaissance is a breakout of a fundamental facet and <span class="italic">flaw</span> of humanity. It must be suppressed.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re sure?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“If we do nothing…” Hari recalled the solutions he had just tried in the fitness-landscape. Let the New Renaissance go and the Empire would dissolve into chaos-states within mere decades. “That might destroy humanity itself.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon grimaced. “Truly? What are my other options?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Squelch these eruptions. The Sarkians are brilliant, true, but they cannot find a shared heart for their people. They are examples of what I call a Solipsism Plague, an excessive belief in the self. It is contagious.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The human toll—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Save the survivors. Send Imperial aid ships through the wormholes—food, counselors, psychers if they’re any help. But <span class="italic">after</span> the disorder has burned itself out.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I see.” Cleon gave him a guarded glance, face slightly averted. “You <span class="italic">are</span> a hard man, Hari.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“When it comes to preserving order, the Empire—yes, sire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Cleon went on to speak of minor matters, as if shying<a id="page575"></a> away from so brutal a topic. Hari was glad he had not asked more.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The long-range predictions showed dire drifts—that the classic dampers in the Empire’s self-learning networks were failing, too. The New Renaissance was but the most flagrant example.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But everywhere he had looked, with his body sensorium tied into the <span class="italic">N</span>-dimensional spectrum, rose the stink of impending chaos. The Empire was breaking down in ways which were <span class="italic">not describable</span> by mere human modes. It was too vast a system to enclose within a single mind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>So soon, within decades, the Empire would start to fragment. Military strength was of little long-term use when the time-honored dampers faltered. The center could not hold.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari could slow that collapse a bit, perhaps—that was all. Soon whole Zones would spiral back to the old attractors: Basic Feudalism, Religious Sanctimony, Femoprimitivism…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Of course, his conclusions were preliminary. He hoped new data would prove him wrong. But he doubted it.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Only after thirty thousand years of suffering would the fever burn out. A new, strong attractor would emerge.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A random mutation of Benign Imperialism? He could not tell.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He could understand all this better with more work. Explore the foundations, get…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>An idea flickered. Foundations? Something there…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But Cleon was going on and events were colliding in his mind. The idea flitted away.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We’ll do great things together, Hari. What do you think about…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>At Cleon’s beck and call, he would never get any work done.</span></p><a id="page576"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Dealing with Lamurk had been disagreeable—but in comparison with this trap of power, easy. How could he get out of <span class="italic">this</span>?</span></p>
