      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>He spent mornings studying the pan data banks. The mathematician in him pondered how to represent their dynamics with a trimmed-down psychohistory. The marble of fate rattling down a cracked slope. So many paths, variables…</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>To get all this he had to kowtow to the station chief. A woman named Yakani, she seemed cordial, but displayed a large portrait of the Academic Potentate upon her office wall. Hari mentioned it and Yakani gushed on about “her mentor,” who had helped her run a primate studies center on a verdant planet some decades before.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“She will bear watching,” Dors said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You don’t think the Potentate would—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“The first assassination attempt—remember the tab? I learned from the Imperials that some technical aspects of it point to an academic laboratory.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari frowned. “Surely my own faction would not oppose—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“She is as ruthless as Lamurk, but more subtle.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“My, you are suspicious.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I must be.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>In the afternoons they took treks. Dors did not like the dust and heat and they saw few animals. “What self-respecting beast would want to be seen with these overdressed Primitivists?” she said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He liked the atmosphere of this world and relaxed<a id="page353"></a> into it, but his mind kept on working. He thought about this as he stood on the sweeping verandah, drinking pungent fruit juice as he watched a sunset. Dors stood beside him silently.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Planets were energy funnels, he thought. At the bottom of their gravitational wells, plants captured barely a tenth of a percent of the sunlight that fell on a world’s surface. They built organic molecules with a star’s energy. In turn, plants were prey for animals, who could harvest roughly a tenth of the plant’s stored energy. Grazers were themselves prey to meat-eaters, who could use about a tenth of the flesh-stored energy. So, he estimated, only about one part in a hundred thousand of the lancing sunlight energy wound up in the predators.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Wasteful! Yet nowhere in the whole Galaxy had a more efficient engine evolved. Why not?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Predators were invariably more intelligent than their prey, and they sat atop a pyramid of very steep slopes. Omnivores had a similar balancing act. Out of that rugged landscape had come humanity.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>That fact <span class="italic">had</span> to matter greatly in any psychohistory. The pans, then, were essential to finding the ancient keys to the human psyche.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Dors said, “I hope immersion isn’t, well, so hot and sticky.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Remember, you’ll see the world through different eyes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Just so I can come back whenever I want and have a nice hot bath.”</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Compartments?” Dors shied back. “They look more like caskets.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“They have to be snug, madam.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>ExSpec Vaddo smiled amiably—which, Hari<a id="page354"></a> sensed, probably meant he wasn’t feeling amiable at all. Their conversation had been friendly, the staff here was respectful of the noted Dr. Seldon, but after all, basically he and Dors were just more tourists. Paying for a bit of primitive fun, all couched in proper scholarly terms, but—tourists.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’re kept in fixed status, all body systems running slow but normal,” the ExSpec said, popping out the padded networks for their inspection. He ran through the controls, emergency procedures, safeguards.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Looks comfortable enough,” Dors observed grudgingly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Come on,” Hari chided. “You promised we would do it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“You’ll be meshed into our systems at all times,” Vaddo said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Even your data library?” Hari asked.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sure thing.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The team of ExSpecs booted them into the stasis compartments with deft, sure efficiency. Tabs, pressers, magnetic pickups were plated onto his skull to pick up thoughts directly. The very latest tech.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ready? Feeling good?” Vaddo asked with his professional smile.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Hari was not feeling good (as opposed to feeling well), and he realized part of it was this ExSpec. He had always distrusted bland, assured people. Both Vaddo and the security chief, Yakani, seemed to be unremarkable Greys. But Dors’ wariness had rubbed off. Something about them bothered him, but he could not say why.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Oh, well, Dors was probably right. He needed a vacation. What better way to get out of yourself?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Good, yes. Ready, yes.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The suspension tech was ancient and reliable. It<a id="page355"></a> suppressed neuromuscular responses, so the customer lay dormant, only his mind engaged with the pan.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Magnetic webs capped over his cerebrum. Through electromagnetic inductance they interwove into layers of the brain. They routed signals along tiny thread-paths, suppressing many brain functions and blocking physiological processes.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>All this, so that the massively parallel circuitry of the brain could be inductively linked out, thought by thought. Then it was transmitted to chips embedded in the pan subject. Immersion.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The technology had ramified throughout the Empire, quite famously. The ability to distantly manage minds had myriad uses. The suspension tech, however, found its own odd applications.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>On some worlds, and in certain Trantorian classes, women were wedded, then suspended for all but a few hours of the day. Their wealthy husbands awoke them from freeze-frame states only for social and sexual purposes. Over a half century, the wives experienced a heady whirlwind of places, friends, parties, vacations, passionate hours—but their total accumulated time was only a few years. Their husbands died in what seemed to the wives like short order, indeed, leaving a wealthy widow of perhaps thirty. Such women were highly sought, and not only for their money. They were uniquely sophisticated, seasoned by a long “marriage.” Often these widows returned the favor, wedding husbands whom they revived for similar uses.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>All this Hari had taken in with the sophisticated veneer he had cultivated on Trantor. So he thought his immersion would be comfortable, interesting, the stuff of stim-party talk.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He had thought that he would in some sense visit another, simpler, mind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He did not expect to be swallowed whole.</span></p>
