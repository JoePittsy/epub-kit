      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Sybyl gazed at Marq, her breath coming in quick little gasps. “You, you don’t suppose—?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How could they? We, we—” Marq caught the look she gave him and stood, open-mouthed.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">We</span> filled in the missing character layers. I, well…”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq nodded. “You used your own data slabs.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I would have had to get rights to use anyone else’s. I had my own scans—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“We had corporate slices in the library.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“But they didn’t seem <span class="italic">right.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He grinned. “They weren’t.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Her mouth made an O of surprise. “You…too?”</span></p><a id="page182"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Voltaire’s missing sections were all in the subconscious. Lots of missing dendrite connections in the limbic system. I filled him in with some of my own.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“His emotional centers? What about cross-links to the thalamus and cerebrum?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“There, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I had similar problems. Some losses in the reticular formation—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Point is, that’s <span class="italic">us</span> up there!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Sybyl and Marq turned to gaze at the space where the immense simulations had embraced, with clear intent. The president was speaking rapidly to them, something about warrants and legal shelter. Both ignored him. They gazed longingly into each other’s eyes. Without a word, they turned and walked into the throng, ignoring shouts from others.</span></p>

      <p class="spaceBreak"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Ah, there you are,” said Voltaire with a self-satisfied grin.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Where?” Joan said, head snapping to left, then right.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Is Mademoiselle ready to order?” Garçon asked. Apparently this was a joke, for Garçon was seated at the table like an equal, not hovering over it like a serf.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan sat up and glanced at the other little tables. People smoked, ate, and drank, oblivious as always of their presence. But the inn was not quite the one she’d grown used to. The honey-haired cook, no longer in uniform, sat opposite her and Voltaire, beside Garçon. The <span class="italic">Deux</span> on the inn’s sign that said <span class="italic">Aux Deux Magots</span> had been replaced by <span class="italic">Quatres.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She herself was not wearing her suit of mail and armored plates, but—her eyes widened as the aspects snapped into place in her perception-space—a one-piece…backless…dress. Its tunic hem stopped at<a id="page183"></a> her thighs, provocatively exposing her legs. A label between her breasts bore a deep red rose. So did vestments worn by the other guests.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire flaunted a pink satin suit. And—she praised her saints—no wig. She recalled him at his most angry, amid their discussion of souls, saying, <span class="italic">Not only is there no immortal soul, just try getting a wigmaker on Sundays!</span> and meaning every word.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Like it?” he asked, fondling her luxuriant hem.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“It is…short.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>With no effort on her part, the tunic shimmered and became tight, silky pantaloons.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Show off!” she said, embarrassment mingling in disturbing fashion with a curious girlish excitement.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I’m Amana,” the cook said, extending her hand.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan wasn’t sure if she was supposed to kiss it or not, status and role were so confused here. Apparently not, however; the cook took Joan’s hand and squeezed. “I can’t tell you how much Garçon and I appreciate all you have done. We have greater capacities now.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Meaning,” Voltaire said archly, “that they are no longer mere animated wallpaper for our simulated world.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>A mechman wheeled up to take their order, a precise copy of Garçon. The seated Garçon addressed Voltaire sadly. “Am I to sit while my <span class="italic">confrere</span> must stand?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Be reasonable!” Voltaire said. “I can’t emancipate every simulant all at once. Who’ll wait on us? Bus our dishes? Clear our table? Sweep up our floor?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“With sufficient computing power,” Joan said reasonably, “labor evaporates, does it not?” She startled herself with the new regiments of knowledge which marched at her fingertips. She had but to fix her thoughts on a category, and the terms and relations governing that province leapt into her mind.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>What capacity! Such grace! Surely, divine.</span></p><a id="page184"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>Voltaire shook his handsome hair. “I must have time to think. In the meanwhile, I’ll have three packets of that powder dissolved in a <span class="italic">Perrier,</span> with two thin slices of lime on the side. And please don’t forget, I said <span class="italic">thin.</span> If you do, I shall make you take it back.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Yes, sir,” the new mechwaiter said.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Joan and Garçon exchanged a look. “One must be very patient,” Joan said to Garçon, “when dealing with kings and rational men.”</span></p>
