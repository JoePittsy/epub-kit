    <div class="chapterBody">
      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Unresponsive to the presence of Madame la Sorcière, the Maid sat upright in her cell, eyes closed. Warring voices pealed inside her head.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The noise was like the din of battle, chaotic and fierce. But if she listened intently, refusing to allow her immortal spirit to be ripped from her mortal flesh—then, then, a divinely orchestrated polyphony would show her the rightful course.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Archangel Michael, and St. Catherine, and St. Margaret—from whose mouths her voices often spoke—were reacting fiercely to her involuntary mastery of Monsieur Arouet’s <span class="italic">Complete Works.</span> Particularly offensive to Michael was the <span class="italic">Elements de Newton,</span> whose philosophy Michael perceived to be incompatible with that of the Church—indeed, with his own existence.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The Maid herself was not so sure. She found, to her surprise, a poetry and harmony in the equations<a id="page160"></a> that proved—as if proof were required—the unsurpassed reality of the Creator, whose physical laws might be fathomable but whose purposes were not.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>How she knew these beauties was rather mysterious. She <span class="italic">saw</span> into the calculus of force and motion, the whirl of worlds. Like the lords and ladies at court, inert matter made its divinely orchestrated gavotte. These things she sensed with her whole self, directly, as if penetrated by divine insight. Beauties <span class="italic">arrived,</span> out of pale air. How could she discount sublime perceptions?</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Such divine invasion must be holy. That it came to her as a flood of memory, skills, associations, only proved further that it was heaven sent. La Sorcière murmured something about computer files and sub-Agents, but those were incantations, not truths.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Far more offensive to her than this new wisdom, far more, was that its author was an <span class="italic">Englishman.</span></span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“<span class="italic">La Henriade,</span>” she told Michael, citing another of Monsieur Arouet’s works, “is more repulsive than <span class="italic">Les Elements.</span> How dare Monsieur Arouet, who arrogantly calls himself by the false name Voltaire, maintain that in England reason is free, while in our own beloved France, it’s shackled to the dark imaginings of absolutist priests! Was it not Jesuit priests who first taught this inquisitor how to reason?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>But what enraged the Maid most of all and made her thrash and strain at her chains—until, fearing for her safety, La Sorcière freed her chafed ankles and wrists—was his illegally printed, scurrilous poem about her. Villainous verse!</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>As soon as she was sure her voices had withdrawn, she waved a copy of ‘<span class="italic">La Pucelle</span>’ at the sorceress, incensed that the chaste Saints Catherine or Margaret—who had momentarily vanished, but would surely return—might be forcibly exposed to<a id="page161"></a> its lewdness. Both saints had already reproached her for her silly, girlish speculations about how attractive Monsieur Arouet might be—what was she thinking?—if he removed his ridiculous wig and lilac ribbons.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“How dare Monsieur Arouet represent me this way?” she railed, knowing full well that her stubborn refusal to call him Voltaire irked him no end. “He adds nine years to my age, dismisses my voices as outright lies. <span class="italic">And</span> slanders Baudricourt, who first enabled me to put before my king my vision for both him and France. A writer of preachy plays and irreverent slanders against the faithful, like <span class="italic">Candide,</span> he well may be—but that insufferable know-it-all calls himself a historian! If his other historical accounts are no more reliable than the one he gives of me, <span class="italic">they</span> and not my body deserve the fire.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>The woman La Sorcière paled before this onslaught. These people—if people they were at all, here in a byzantine, cloudy Purgatory—backed away from the true ferocity of divine Purpose. Joan towered over the woman, with some relish.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Newton’s clockwork wisdom is an intriguing vision of Creation’s laws,” Joan thundered, “but Voltaire’s history is a work of his imagination!—made up of three parts bile, two spleen.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>She raised her right arm in the same gesture she’d used to lead her soldiers and the knights of France into battle against the English king and his minions—of whom, she now saw <span class="italic">clearly,</span> Monsieur Arouet de Voltaire was one. A warrior <span class="italic">femme inspiratrice</span> with an intense aversion to the kill, she now vowed all-out war against this, this—she gasped in exasperation, “This nouveau riche bourgeois upstart darling of the aristocratic class, who’s never known real want or need, and thinks horses are bred with carriages behind them.”</span></p><a id="page162"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“Get him!” La Sorcière, ablaze with the Maid’s fire, raged. “That’s what we want!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Where is he?” demanded the Maid. “Where is this shallow little <span class="italic">pissoir</span> stream?—that I may drown him in the depths of all I have suffered!”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Oddly, La Sorcière seemed pleased by all this, as if it fit some design of her own.</span></p>
