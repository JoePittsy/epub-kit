      <p class="chapterOpenerText"><span>Hari Seldon stared at the images and data-rivers. “Voltaire suffered a recall storm. And look at the implications.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq peered without comprehension at the torrent. “Uh, I see.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That promontory—a memory nugget about a debate he had with Joan, <span class="italic">eight thousand years ago.</span>”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Somebody used these sims before—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“For public debate, yes. History not only repeats itself, sometimes it stutters.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Faith vs. Reason?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Faith/Mechanicals vs. Reason/Human Will,” Seldon said, as if reading them directly from the numerical complexes. Marq could not follow the connections fast enough to keep up with him. “A society of that time had a fundamental division over computer intelligences and their…manifestations.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq caught an elusive flicker in Seldon’s face. Was he hiding something? “Manifestations? You mean, like tiktoks?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Something like that,” Seldon said stiffly.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Voltaire’s for—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“In that age, he was for human effervescence. Joan favored Faith, which meant, uh, tiktoks.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I don’t get it.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Tiktoks, or higher forms of them, were deemed capable of guiding humanity.” Seldon seemed uncomfortable.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span><span class="italic">“Tiktoks?”</span> Marq snorted derisively.</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Or, uh, higher forms.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“That’s what Voltaire and Joan were debating eight thousand years ago? So they were engineered for this. Who won?”</span></p><a id="page132"></a>

      <p class="para"><span>“The result is suppressed. I believe it became an irrelevant issue. No computer intelligences could be made which could guide humanity.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq nodded. “Makes sense. Machines will never be as smart as <span class="italic">we</span> are. Day-to-day business, sure, but—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“I suggest erasure of the embedded memory complex,” Seldon said curtly. “That will eliminate the interfering layer.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Uh, if you think that’s best. I’m not sure we can disconnect every tie-in to those memories, though. These sims use holographic recall, so it’s lodged—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“To get the results you wish in this upcoming debate, it is crucial. There could be other implications, too.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Such as?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Historians might mine sims like these for lost data on the far past. They would want access. Deny them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Oh, sure. I mean, not likely we’d let anybody use them.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Seldon gazed at the shifting slabs of pattern. “They <span class="italic">are</span> complex, aren’t they? Minds of real depth, interacting subselves…Ummm…I wonder how the whole sense of selfhood remains stable? How come their mentalities don’t just crash?”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Marq couldn’t follow, but he said, “I guess those ancients, they knew a few tricks we don’t.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Seldon nodded. “Indeed. There’s a glimmer of an idea here….”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>He stood quickly and Marq rose. “Couldn’t you stay? I know Sybyl would like to talk—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Sorry, must go. Matters of state.”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>“Uh, well, thanks for—”</span></p>

      <p class="para"><span>Seldon was gone before Marq could close his gaping mouth.</span></p>
